A huge amount of wastes is being generated during the processing/cutting/sizing of these stones to make them useable. These wastes are disposed of in the open environment and the toxic nature of these wastes negatively affects the environmental and human health. A large number of researches have been conducted in the past on the recycling of these wastes in the construction industry for the preparation of concrete as the replacement of cement and fine or coarse aggregates (FCA) and also in some other applications. Although this effort contributes substantially towards the society in terms of health and economy, it is not adequate as the wastes keep increasing day by day. This study is based on reviewing the published research reports on the effects of waste marble and granite dust (WMGD) on the physico-mechanical properties of concrete. It is observed that the use of marble dust and granite dust at a certain amount reduced the cost of construction, and the concrete properties are positively affected. Additionally, the effects of marble and granite dust filling on the properties and performance of polymer composites have also been reviewed. As a case study, the findings of an investigation carried out by the authors regarding the characteristics of a class of glass-polyester composites loaded up with waste marble dust are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cement and concrete; Granite dust; Marble dust; Polymer composites; Waste utilization","Cements; Concrete aggregates; Construction industry; Developing countries; Granite; Marble; Waste disposal; Cement and concretes; Environmental health; Fine aggregates; Granite dust; Human health; Marble dust; Open environment; Ornamental stone; Polymer composite; Structural applications; Dust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"UN-Habitat, Urbanization and Sustainable Development in the Third World : an Unrecognized Global Issue (1989), http://digitallibrary.un.org/record/103115, United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) Nairobi 1989; Halicka, A., Ogrodnik, P., Zegardlo, B., Using ceramic sanitary ware waste as concrete aggregate Using ceramic sanitary ware waste as concrete aggregate (2013) Construct.

The rate of disposal of this waste has increased over the years. As a result, the widespread dumping of Bakelite plastic waste (BPW) has raised several severe environmental concerns. One possible solution is to use this discarded material as a conventional aggregate substitution in concrete. Environmental and ecological problems can be partially solved by reusing Bakelite waste products into concrete elements. This study analyses the behavior of concrete containing discarded Bakelite as fine aggregate at various replacement percentages. Bakelite waste material is non-recycled and serves as a limited substitution for natural grained waste. The density is a highly significant characteristic as it indicates the intrinsic strength of the building to be constructed, and Bakelite plastic is the ideal option due to its thermoplastic polymer, corrosion resistance, and ideal density. An experimental outcome has been made using Bakelite plastic waste particles as fine aggregates in concrete by substitution ranging from 0 % to 15 % with an increment of 2.5 % on the strength benchmarks of standard concrete. The tests are compressive, abrasion, impact energy, water absorption, water permeability, and microstructural properties of concrete with and without Bakelite plastic waste as aggregates were observed, exhibiting good strengths. Strength parameters were examined for optimum concrete and obtained 7.5 % BPW content in fly ash-based concrete mix outstanding strength properties. © 2022","Abrasion resistance; Bakelite plastic waste; Ideal density; Impact resistance; Plastic aggregate; Water-based experiments","Abrasion; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Corrosion resistance; Erosion; Fly ash; Recycling; Toxic materials; Waste disposal; Wear resistance; Bakelite plastic waste; Business industry; Fine aggregates; Ideal density; Plastic aggregate; Plastics waste; Recycling rate; Valorisation; Water based; Water-based experiment; Water absorption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Usahanunth, N., Tuprakay, S., Kongsong, W., Tuprakay, S.R., Study of mechanical properties and recommendations for the application of waste Bakelite aggregate concrete (2018) Case Stud.

On the other hand, waste vehicle tires are a global environmental problem due to reasons such as releasing toxic chemicals to nature, not being biodegradable. The recycling of waste tires will prevent any potential harmful effects on the ecosystem. In this study; the effect of vehicle waste tires on the mechanical, hardness and stress–strain properties of polyester-based polymer concretes has been investigated. In polymer concrete mixtures, the polyester resin/ filling material ratio is selected as 15–85%, 20–80%, 25–75%. Waste tire with the diameters of 0–1 mm and 0–4 mm used by replacing the natural aggregates of the same diameters at the rates of 0%, 5%, 12.5%, 20%. Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), Schmidt rebound hammer number, stress–strain behavior, and compressive strength tests were evaluated. As a result, as the waste tire ratio increases, the strength decreases, however, ductility increased at low resin ratios. When the Schmidt rebound hammer number and the compressive strength results are related, there is a similarity of 96.07% in the regression line and polymer concrete gives better results than normal concrete. Furthermore, the use of 0–4 mm sieve diameter tire gives higher strength than 0–1 mm. It is more advantageous as the recycling cost of 0–4 mm diameter tires is lower than 0–1 mm due to the energy consumed during the disintegration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Compressive strength; Polyester resin; Polymer concrete; Schmidt rebound hammer test; Stress–strain curve; Waste tire","Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Hammers; Hardness; Polyester resins; Polypropylenes; Stresses; Tires; Mechanical hardness; Mechanical stress; Polymer concretes; Rebound hammer number; Rebound hammers; Schmidt; Schmidt rebound hammer test; Stress-strain property; Stress/strain curves; Waste tires; Compressive strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2013), M.

This study aims to see the incorporation of bone china ceramic waste (BCCW) in self-compacting concrete (SCC) as a partial substitution for cement. BCCW was used at a percentage of 0 to 40% with an improved step level of 10% through mass of cement. Different properties of SCC were examined for the fresh and hardened state. Various fresh properties of SCC as slump flow, V-funnel, L-box height, J-ring, and T500 were examined, and results are found acceptable within the EFNARC limitation. To assess the hardened property of concrete, compressive strength, flexural strength, water absorption and ultrasonic pulse velocity experiments were performed. The experimental results exhibited that incorporating up to 10% BCCW in SCC enhanced the compressive and flexural strength. However, on further inclusion of BCCW (beyond 10%), decrease in the strength of modified SCC was observed. Moreover, superior ultrasonic pulse velocity and better resistance to water absorption were found on the inclusion of up to 20% BCCW in SCC. The experimental results of scanning electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction also showed the dense concrete matrix and higher hydration products on the inclusion of up to 10% BCCW in SCC. Study concluded that the inclusion of up to 10% BCCW in SCC increases the fresh and hardened characteristics of concrete and can be effectively used in the concrete industry as a substitute material for natural sources. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","Bone china ceramic waste; Fresh properties; Hardened properties; Scanning electron microscopic; Self-compacting concrete; X-ray diffraction",,,,,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge MNIT Jaipur and IIT Jodhpur for using microstructural techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gautam, L., Jain, J.K., Kalla, P., Choudhary, S., A review on the utilization of ceramic waste in sustainable construction products (2020) Mater Today: Proc; Jain, A., Gupta, R., Chaudhary, S., Performance of self-compacting concrete comprising granite cutting waste as fine aggregate (2019) Constr Build Mater, 221, pp. 539-552; El-Dieb, A.S., Kanaan, D.M., Ceramic waste powder an alternative cement replacement – Characterization and evaluation (2018) Sustain Mater Technol, 17, p. e00063; Aly, S.T., El-Dieb, A.S., Taha, M.R., Effect of high-volume ceramic waste powder as partial cement replacement on fresh and compressive strength of self-compacting concrete (2019) J Mater Civ Eng, 31, pp. 1-11; Jain, A., Gupta, R., Chaudhary, S., Sustainable development of self-compacting concrete by using granite waste and fly ash (2020) Constr Build Mater, 262, p. 120516; Jain, A., Chaudhary, S., Gupta, R., Mechanical and microstructural characterization of fly ash blended self-compacting concrete containing granite waste (2022) Constr Build Mater, 314, p. 125480; Gautam, L., Kumar Jain, J., Jain, A., Kalla, P., Valorization of bone-china ceramic powder waste along with granite waste in self-compacting concrete (2022) Constr Build Mater, 315, p. 125730; Lu, G., Liu, P., Wang, Y., Faßbender, S., Wang, D., Oeser, M., Development of a sustainable pervious pavement material using recycled ceramic aggregate and bio-based polyurethane binder (2019) J Clean Prod, 220, pp. 1052-1060; Choudhary, R., Gupta, R., Nagar, R., Jain, A., Mechanical and abrasion resistance performance of silica fume, marble slurry powder, and fly ash amalgamated high strength self-consolidating concrete (2021) Constr Build Mater, 269, p. 121282; Choudhary, R., Gupta, R., Nagar, R., Impact on fresh, mechanical, and microstructural properties of high strength self-compacting concrete by marble cutting slurry waste, fly ash, and silica fume (2020) Constr Build Mater, 239, p. 117888; Amjadi, R., Monazami, M., Mohseni, E., Azar Balgouri, H., Ranjbar, M.M., Effectiveness of different recycled materials in self-compacting mortar (2017) Eur J Environ Civ Eng, 21, pp. 1485-1501; Huseien, G.F., Sam, A.R.M., Shah, K.W., Mirza, J., Effects of ceramic tile powder waste on properties of self-compacted alkali-activated concrete (2020) Constr Build Mater, 236, p. 117574; Jerônimo, V.L., Meira, G.R., da Silva Filho, L.C.P., Performance of self-compacting concretes with wastes from heavy ceramic industry against corrosion by chlorides (2018) Constr Build Mater, 169, pp. 900-910; de Matos, P.R., Prudêncio, L.R., de Oliveira, A.L., Pelisser, F., Gleize, P.J.P., Use of porcelain polishing residue as a supplementary cimentitious material in self-compacting concrete (2018) Constr Build Mater, 193, pp. 623-630; Medina, C., Sánchez De Rojas, M.I., Thomas, C., Polanco, J.A., Frías, M., Durability of recycled concrete made with recycled ceramic sanitary ware aggregate.

Therefore, a novel and green recycling approach is urgent. Here, MSWIBA is recycled by manufacturing artificial light coarse aggregates (ALCAs) and used as coarse aggregates to partially replace natural aggregates (NAs) to design green concrete. In this work, ALCAs made of MSWIBA replaced NAs with different percentages (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) to manufacture artificial lightweight coarse aggregate concrete (ALCAC). The influence of specific gravity, compressive strength, splitting strength, carbonization performance and micro properties of ALCAC were studied. It was observed that with an increase in the replacement rate of ALCAs, the specific gravity of ALCAC decreased by up to 12.1%, and the mechanical properties also declined. However, the compressive strength can still reach more than 30 MPa, and the splitting strength can reach more than 3.3 MPa. In addition, an increase in the ALCA content also led to an increase in the ALCAC matrix pores, and CO2 was more likely to invade the concrete interior, which increased the depth of concrete carbonization. The hydration products of ALCAC make the interface zones (ITZs) rougher, and the bonding effect in the ITZ area is significantly better than that of NAC. Compared with fly ash (FA) light aggregate concrete, ALCAC has lower energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This study provides insight into the recycling of MSWIBA and application of ALCAs for sustainable RC structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial lightweight coarse aggregate concrete; Carbonation; Environmental and economic impacts; Mechanical properties and microstructure; Municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash; Resource substitution","Ash handling; Carbon dioxide; Carbonization; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Density (specific gravity); Durability; Energy utilization; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Hydration; Light weight concrete; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Aggregate concrete; Artificial lightweight coarse aggregate concrete; Artificial lightweight coarse aggregates; Coarse aggregates; Environmental and economic impacts; Mechanical property and microstructure; Municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash; Municipal solid-waste incinerations; Properties and microstructures; Resource substitution; Ashes",,,,,"KCXFZ20201221173202008; Shenzhen International Cooperation Research Project: GJHZ20180928155602083; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Durability for Marine Civil Engineering, GDDCE: 2020B1212060074","The work described in this paper was fully supported by grants Shenzhen Sustainable Development Technology Project ( KCXFZ20201221173202008 ), Shenzhen International Cooperation Research Project ( GJHZ20180928155602083 ) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Durability for Marine Civil Engineering ( 2020B1212060074 ).",,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Khaiat, H., Haque, N., Strength and durability of lightweight and normal weight concrete (1999) J.

A large amount of natural resource is utilized to meet the demand of concrete production, which causes environmental issues; also, enriched properties of concrete with low density are demanded. Consequently, the idea of lightweight concrete (LWC) has gained popularity. Practically, there is a vast potential of using waste byproducts of the various sectors in LWC; thus, it could also be taken as a sustainable waste management solution. Extensive studies have been carried out on the use of various waste byproducts in LWC as an aggregate, cementing agent, admixture, and their combinations. The current paper reviews the research status, gaps, challenges and solutions of the use of waste byproducts of various sectors in LWC. Various governing factors are identified to use waste byproducts in different roles in LWC, i.e., material, admixture, or combination of both; based on which, the suitability of the use of any waste material in LWC can be assessed. Despite a large number of conducted studies, characterization of more waste material for use in LWC, assessment, and mitigation of hazardous impacts of waste byproducts in LWC, durability, and life cycle assessment of waste-based LWC are identified as the research dimensions to be further focused. The current paper aims to benefit the associated researchers and practitioners working in the fields of construction, waste management, sustainable development, resources conservations, and recycling. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental management; Lightweight aggregate; Lightweight concrete; Resources conservations; Waste management","Concrete aggregates; Life cycle; Light weight concrete; Sustainable development; Waste management; 'current; Admixture; Environmental concerns; Lightweight aggregates; Lightweight concrete; Management scheme; Resource conservation; Social concerns; Sustainable reuse; Waste byproducts; Environmental management",,,,,"AM-2021-LT-1825, GA 20-00630S; Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR; Ministerstvo školstva, vedy, výskumu a športu Slovenskej republiky; Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja, APVV; Vedecká Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR a SAV, VEGA: 1/0680/20","The authors would like to express their deepest gratitude for the financial support provided by the Education Exchanges Support Foundation (Agreement No. AM-2021-LT-1825).

Additionally, reducing water usage is an increasing concern, as the concrete industry currently uses 10% of the world’s industrial water. Therefore, building upon our previous work, this research explores the use of polymer hybrid carbon and glass composite waste products as reinforcements in high-pressure compacted cement. Our material used nearly 70% less water during manufacturing and exhibited improved durability and salt corrosion resistance. Compression strength tests were performed on high-pressure compacted materials containing 6.0 wt% recycled admixtures before and after saltwater aging, and the results showed that the material retained 90% of its original compression strength after aging, as it contained fewer pores and cavities. Our experimental work was supplemented by molecular dynamics. Simulations, which indicated that the synergetic effects of compaction and FCP admixture addition slowed the diffusion of corrosive salt ions by an average of 84%. Thus, our high-pressure compacted cement material may be suitable for extended use in marine environments, while also reducing the amount of commercial fiber composite polymer waste material that is sent to the landfill. Article Highlights: Fiber composite waste was successfully recycled into denser, high-pressure compacted ordinary Portland cement materials.High-pressure compacted cement samples containing 6% recycled admixtures retained 90% of their compression strength after salt aging.The high-pressure compaction method utilized 70% less water during specimen fabrication. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cement;

It is possible that eventually, there could be a significant risk to human lives and the survival of plant and animal life on this planet from hazardous biomedical waste disposal. Biomedical waste is usually burnt at an incineration plant and produces ash called incinerated biomedical waste ash (IBWA). If IBWA is not disposed correctly, it may contaminate the groundwater because heavy metals not eliminated during the incineration process. The groundwater contamination problem due to IBWA may be minimised using geopolymer concrete (GPC). When discussing pollution and the environment, another big issue involves waste glass. There was a rise in the quantity of waste glass generated each day, and the recycling region is restricted. To minimise this issue, we can exploit the waste glass powder in the construction sectors. The substitute for cement concrete is geopolymer concrete which was predominantly manufactured from renewable resources. This research work aims to produce the geopolymer concrete at room temperature. The ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) with IBWA ratio is fixed as 70:30, and the fine aggregate (M-Sand) is replaced with varying the glass powder as 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% and 50% have been done and cured under ambient curing. The addition of IBWA and glass powder has been performed to increase the reactivity and performance of geopolymer concrete. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Geopolymer concrete; GGBS; Incinerated biomedical waste ash; Mechanical properties; Rheological properties; Waste glass powder",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education for providing Equipment for testing and conducting research.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mehta, P.K., Greening of the concrete industry for sustainable development (2002) Concr Int, 24, pp. 23-28; Schneider, M., Romer, M., Tschudin, M., Bolio, H., Sustainable cement production - present and future (2011) Cem Concr Res, 43, pp. 642-650; Ali, M.B., Saidur, R., Hossain, M.S., A review on emission analysis in cement industries (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 2252-2261; Frederico, L.M., Chidiac, S.E., Waste glass as a supplementary cementitious material in concrete – critical review of treatment methods (2009) Cem Concr Compos, 31, pp. 606-610; Papadakis, V.G., Tsimas, S., Supplementary cementing materials in concrete Part I: efficiency and design (2002) Cem Concr Res, 32, pp. 1525-1532; Horishi, U., Shunsuke, H., Recycling of waste as an alternative raw material and fuel in cement manufacturuing (1997) Waste materials used in concrete manufacturing, pp. 430-551. , Noyes publications, United States of America; Ganesh, A.C., Muthukannan, M., A review of recent developments in geopolymer concrete (2018) Int J Eng Technol, 7, pp. 696-699; Ganesh, A.C., Muthukannan, M., Aakassh, P.S., Subramanaian, B., Energy efficient production of geopolymer bricks using industrial waste (2020) IOP Conf Ser: Mater Sci Eng, 872, p. 012154; Ganesh, A.C., Muthukannan, M., Development of high performance sustainable optimized fiber concrete and prediction of compressive strength (2020) J Clean Prod; Chithambar Ganesh, A., Muthukannan, M., Investigation on the glass fiber reinforced geopolymer concrete made of M-sand (2019) IOP Conf Ser: Mater Sci Eng, 561, p. 012014; Arunkumar, K., Muthukannan, M., Dinesh Babu, A., Hariharan, A.L., Muthuramalingam, T., Effect on addition of Polypropylene fibers in wood ash-fly ash based geopolymer concrete (2020) IOP Conf Ser: Mater Sci Eng, 872, p. 012162; Caijun, S., Keren, Z., A review on the use of waste glasses in the production of cement and concrete (2007) Resour Conserv Recycl, 52, pp. 234-247; Byars, E.A., Morales-Hernandez, B., Zhu, H.Y., Waste glass as concrete aggregate and pozzolan.

Application of SW as an asphalt binder performance extender is an economical solution to decrease virgin binder usage, as well as toxic gas emission. The present study investigates the potential use of SW as a partial substitution for sustainable pavement construction. Asphalt cement binder was partially substituted with different percentages of SW (10%, 20%, and 30% by weight). The resultant binders were subjected to penetration, ductility, softening point, absolute viscosity, elastic modulus, durability, and cracking index tests. Furthermore, a total of three sulfur waste-asphalt concrete (SWAC) mixtures and one asphalt concrete (AC) reference mixture were designed for the study. Three SWAC mixtures were designed with 10%, 20%, and 30% SW content, respectively. Mechanical and durability tests including Marshall stability, Marshall quotient, static indirect tensile strength at 25 and 60 °C, tensile strength ratio, and flexural strength at 0 and 15 °C were conducted on AC and SWAC mixtures. Results indicate that 10% SW-substituted binder show lower softening point and durability and keep the ductility value at a minimum range of ASTM specification of 100+ cm and temperature susceptibility in the preferable range. The SWAC mixtures show lower Marshall stability and moisture susceptibility. The values of stability and tensile strength ratio are still greater than the minimum values of ASTM specification limit up to 20% SW. Although flexural strain values of 10% SWAC mixtures is lower than those of control mixtures, these strain values considered to be acceptable. Overall, 10% of SW by weight of asphalt can be recycled and used as sustainable materials for paving applications to that found in this study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.","Cracking index; Durability; Flexural strength; Sulfur waste; Sustainable materials; Temperature susceptibility; Tensile strength","Bending strength; Binders; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Cracks; Ductility; Durability; Gas emissions; Mixtures; Recycling; Specifications; Sulfur; Waste disposal; Asphalt concrete mixtures; ASTM specifications; Cracking index; Marshall stability; Softening points; Strain values; Sulphur waste; Sustainable materials; Temperature susceptibility; Tensile strength ratios; Tensile strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Hadidy, A.I., (2001) Influence of Polyethylene and Sulfur Waste on Characteristics of Asphalt Paving Materials, , M.Sc. thesis, Baghdad-Iraq; Engineering evaluation of sulphur-asphalt mixtures (1977) Transportation Research Record, 659, pp. 12-17. , Transportation Research Record, Washington, DC; Bencowitz, I., Boe, E.S., Effect of Sulphur upon some of the Properties of Asphalts (1938) Proc.

The common way of recycling this waste is by crushing it, where it was used as an alternative fine aggregate for concrete production. But the crushing technique has led to the formation of micro-cracks in the funnel glass products, causing to high lead leaching rate. On the other hand, recycling the CRT funnel glass waste through melting and annealing operations in producing the spherical CRT glass (GS) has proven will not danger the environment due to the leaching of lead. Therefore, this paper explored the feasibility of using GS as partial (20%, 50%) and full replacements (100%) of natural coarse aggregates in concrete. The workability, density, compressive strength, and splitting tensile strength were investigated. Given the importance of materials and exposure, the influence of silica fume content and CRT concrete strength subjected to high temperature were evaluated. Overall, the inclusion of GS increased the workability and decreased the density, but reduced the compressive and tensile strength. The use of GS as coarse aggregates should be limited to below 50% due to its negative impacts on the strength aspects have become obvious. However, the results show that the CRT concrete made with 20% GS and 10% silica fume have comparable properties with the control, 52 MPa where only 7% lower than control concrete. The addition of silica fume able to counteract the negative effect of GS. © 2022 Tamkang University.","Cathode ray tube; Concrete; Lead; Strength; Waste glass","Cathode rays; Cathodes; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Crushing; Glass; Leaching; Recycling; Silica fume; Tensile strength; Cathode-ray tube; Coarse aggregates; Fine aggregates; Funnel glass; Human health; Lead; Spherical glass; Strength; Toxic effect; Waste glass; Cathode ray tubes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pant, D., Singh, P., Pollution due to hazardous glass waste (2014) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 21 (4), pp. 2414-2436; Zhao, H., Poon, C.

In recent years, a growing number of studies are primarily associated with utilization of e-waste as construction materials. This paper provides a critical and comprehensive review of different types of e-waste which can be utilized as source material in the form of binder, fine/coarse aggregate, and fibre in the mortar, concrete, and precast products. More specifically, this review highlights the positive aspects, future research needs, and limitations of using e-waste in construction. Overall, it is suggested that e-waste offers huge potential benefits when it is utilized in construction products, thereby reduces e-waste management problems and saves the earth from environmental pollution. © 2021","Concrete; CRT glass; e-plastic; e-waste; PVC fibre; Recycling","Electronic Waste; Glass; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Pollution; Polyvinyl chlorides; Waste disposal; Wastes; Construction products; CRT glass; E-plastic; Electronics wastes; Exponentials; Future research directions; Glasses In; PVC fiber; Waste glass; Waste plastic; Heavy metals; 1,3 butadiene; acrylonitrile; acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; barium; cadmium; copper; lead; nitric oxide; phosphorus; polyamide; polycarbonate; polystyrene; radon; strontium; styrene; thorium; titanium dioxide; unclassified drug; uranium; volatile organic compound; zinc; concrete; electronic waste; future prospect; glass; plastic waste; polymer; recycling; waste disposal; waste management; Bacillus subtilis; biomineralization; bulk density; chemical composition; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); construction and demolition waste; e-waste; environmental impact; gamma radiation; leaching; particle size; photocatalysis; porosity; precipitation; recycling; Review; shear strength; tensile strength; thermal conductivity; waste component removal; waste management; Young modulus",,"1,3 butadiene, 106-99-0, 25339-57-5; acrylonitrile, 107-13-1; barium, 7440-39-3; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; polyamide, 63428-83-1; polycarbonate, 24936-68-3, 25766-59-0; polystyrene, 9003-53-6; radon, 10043-92-2; strontium, 7440-24-6; styrene, 100-42-5; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; uranium, 7440-61-1; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the research grant IIRG002B-2020IISS.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Anantharam, H., Parthasarathy, P., Hegde, M.N., Chandrasekaraiah, T., A design for novel usage of the funnel glass from CRTs (2015) Transact.

SiMnS is a byproduct of alloy steel production. Depending on the process of solidification, the slag is available in crystalline hard stone type and granulated glassy form. The latter one is more reactive due to the presence of amorphous phases. Therefore, granulated slag has been mostly used as supplementary cementitious material, either blending with clinker or as a precursor for alkali activated binder. Whereas the former is less reactive, and has been mostly used as aggregate, which can enhance the properties of the concrete. The reactive component such as CaO and SiO2 improve the binding capability of the cement gel. The leaching of toxic and heavy metals from the SiMnS reacted binder matrix is not reported. This paper also highlights the future potential of this slag by a process called slag engineering to modify its chemistry similar to granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), to be utilized more effectively. © 2021","Aggregate; Alkali activated binder; Silico-manganese slag; Slag cement; Slag engineering","Aggregates; Blast furnaces; Blending; Cement industry; Manganese; Portland cement; Silica; Steelmaking; Alkali-activated binder; Amorphous phasis; Geopolymer concrete; Granulated slags; Portland cement concretes; Property; Silico-manganese slag; Slag engineering; Steel production; Supplementary cementitious material; Slags; alkali; calcium oxide; cement; silicon dioxide; aggregate; cement (construction material); concrete; construction material; leaching; manganese; slag; solidification; carbon footprint; chemical composition; mineralogy; physical parameters; powder; recycling; Review; silico manganese slag; slag; temperature; X ray diffraction",,"calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9",,,,"The authors are grateful to the Director, CSIR-National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur, India, for his kind permission to publish the paper.

In this study, the effects of substituting recycled electronic waste, i.e., printed circuit board (PCB) dust, and fly ash (FA) concurrently as a partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated to explore a novel electronic waste recycling method and new material of construction. The decisive parameters of e-waste mixed cement SCC are workability characteristics and hardened properties. According to the design of experiments, the ratio of PCB dust waste in OPC were 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% whilst the ratio of FA in OPC were 10%, 20%, and 30% by volume. Workability characteristics were verified by means of rheological behaviors, i.e., slump diameter, T500 flow time, test V-funnel test, J-Ring test and L-box test. Compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity up to 180 days were determined for its hardened properties. According to the result, recycled PCB dust with FA can be used as cement replacement for SCC. Combining use of recycled PCB dust and FA as filler and pozzolanic synergistically yielded satisfactory results, e.g., greater than 60 MPa of compressive strength at 28 days for 5% PCB dust and 10% FA. In addition, compressive strength at 180 days of highest cement replacement level at 60% was greater than 40 MPa. Eventually, there are opportunities to use combined PCB dust and FA as cement replacement in SCC which yields cost saving and eco-sustainable SCC products that are economically and environmentally beneficial for the construction industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cement replacement; Mechanical properties; Printed circuit board; Self-compacting concrete; Sustainability","Compressive strength; Design of experiments; Fly ash; Hardening; Portland cement; Recycling; Self compacting concrete; Sustainable development; Tensile strength; Timing circuits; Cement replacement; Electronic waste recycling; Electronics wastes; Hardened properties; Metallics; Ordinary Portland cement; Partial replacement; Printed circuit board wastes; Social ecosystems; Well being; Printed circuit boards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdelbasir, S.M., El-Sheltawy, C.T., Abdo, D.M., Green processes for electronic waste recycling: a review (2018) J.

Box 24729, Nicosia, 1303, Cyprus, Department of Civil Engineering, Frederick University, Nicosia, 1036, Cyprus","The discovery of an innovative class of inorganic polymers has brought forth a revolution in the history of construction technology. Now, no energy-intensive reactions at elevated temperatures are essential, as found in the case of contemporary cement production. In addition to their attributes of low energy and a mitigated carbon footprint, geopolymeric composites can incorporate diversely originated and profound wastes in their manufacturing. As of today, profoundly accessible landfills of rubber tyre waste negatively impact the environment, water, and soil, with many health hazards. Their nonbiodegradable complex chemical structure supports recycling, and toxic gases are emitted by burning them, leading to aesthetic issues. These, altogether, create great concern for well-thought-out disposal methods. One of the achievable solutions is processing this waste into alternative aggregates to thus generate increased economic value whilst reducing primary aggregate consumption through the incorporation of these vast automobile solid wastes in the manufacturing of geopolymer construction composites, e.g., binders, mortar, concrete, etc., produced through the process of geopolymerization as a replacement for natural aggregates, providing relief to the crisis of the degradation of restricted natural aggregate resources. Currently, tyre rubber is one of the most outstanding materials, extensively employed in scores of engineering applications. This manuscript presents a state-of-the-art review of value-added applications in the context of rubberized geopolymer building composites and a review of past investigations. More significantly, this paper reviews rubberized geopolymer composites for their value-added applications. © 2021 by the authors.

This sector is currently shifting away from natural materials and cement in favor of alternative materials, thereby reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability. Worldwide, enormous quantities of waste materials are generated. Most of these waste materials are hazardous, corrosive, flammable, chemically reactive, incendiary, and infectious and are typically disposed of in landfills, causing environmental pollution and posing health risks. As a result, incorporating waste materials into concrete would be a more prudent course of action. This study collected vast bibliometric data comprising journal articles and review articles from the Scopus database over the last two decades and conducted a scientometric review on waste material utilization in concrete. Scientometric analysis is used to determine the current state of research by analyzing available bibliometric data and identifying related publication areas, sources with the most publications, the most frequently occurring keywords, authors, and papers with the most citations, and states that have made the greatest contribution to the field of waste materials utilization in concrete. Moreover, the most active research areas are identified and discussed. Also, the sustainability aspects of recycling waste materials in concrete are discussed, and finally, future research is proposed. The scientometric review will enable scholars from diverse countries to exchange novel ideas and knowledge, foster research collaboration, and establish joint ventures. © 2021 The Authors","Concrete; Construction material; Sustainable construction; Waste material","Cement industry; Construction industry; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Flammable materials; Health risks; Knowledge management; Pollution induced corrosion; Sustainable development; Alternative materials; Construction sectors; Environmental pollutions; Impact on the environment; Material utilization; Research collaborations; Scientometric analysis; Sustainable construction; Concretes",,,,,"Politechnika Krakowska, CUT","This research was funded by the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Cracow University of Technology , and the Department of Civil Engineering, COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus .",,,,,,,,,,,,"Antoun, M., Issa, C.A., Aouad, G., Gerges, N., Sustainable masonry blocks: olive wood waste as substitute for fine aggregates (2021) Case Stud.

The use of DSS in self-compacting concrete (SCC) was studied by partially substituting pozzolana Portland cement at different percentages. This represents the recycling element of the 3 R’s of the environment (reduce, reuse and recycle). Mechanical and permeability properties were evaluated and the microstructure of SCC analysed with respect to a control mixture which is without sandstone slurry. Mechanical and permeability parameters were found to relate each other. With increased replacement of DSS, the porosity and hence the sorptivity coefficient of SCC also increased and its compressive strength decreased. The higher porosity caused a significant increment in the depth of carbonation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed decreased calcium-silicate-hydrate (C–S–H) gel formation as the replacement percentage of DSS increased. This, along with the increased porosity and permeability, degraded the mechanical properties of SCC. The rapidly developing construction sector in India must meet the following indispensable criteria: low environmental impact at improved structural performance, economy and speed of construction. Utilization of sandstone waste is highly recommended from the above viewpoint. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Carbonation; Compressive strength; Density; Porosity;

CBs leach toxic components into the soil, including heavy metals, tar, and many other chemical compounds. Approximately 7.2 billion CBs are discarded every year in Australia, and 16.8 billion CBs accumulate in the waste management system annually. In previous work, the encapsulation method for CB with bitumen and paraffin wax was developed and encapsulated CB in dense graded asphalt (DGA) was evaluated using bitumen classes C320, C170, and C600. In recent studies, the encapsulation method was improved, and the possible use of bitumen-encapsulated CB (BECB) in stone mastic asphalt (SMA) was demonstrated. To build on this foundational research, the current work aimed to investigate the use of improved BECB in heavy-duty DGA prepared with polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) class A10E. Samples were prepared following VicRoads and Austroads guidelines. In this research, the Marshall stability and flow, resilient modulus, dynamic creep, tensile strength ratio, and indirect tension fatigue test were performed to evaluate the performance of BECB-modified DGA. The results were compared with the control DGA prepared with industry-standard conventional materials. Test results suggested that using 0.5% and 1% BECB in DGA met the industry requirements and endorsed the recycling method of CB in asphalt concrete. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cigarette butts (CB); Dense graded asphalt (DGA); Encapsulation; Fatigue; Recycling; Rutting","Concrete industry; Electric circuit breakers; Fatigue testing; Heavy metals; Recycling; Tensile strength; Tobacco; Waste management; Conventional materials; Encapsulation methods; Industry requirements; Industry standards; Polymer-modified bitumen; Stone mastic asphalts; Tensile strength ratios; Waste management systems; Mastic asphalt; asphalt; creep; dynamic analysis; fatigue; guideline; landfill; performance assessment; recycling; stability analysis; structural analysis; tensile strength; waste management; Australia",,,,,"RMIT University, RMIT","This work is part of an ongoing postgraduate study on recycling cigarette butts in bitumen and asphalt concrete.

Conventional micro-size fly ash produced from burning crude oil in Jizan electrical power plant in Saudi Arabia was used in this study. The size of conventional crude oil ash waste reduced from micro-scale to nano-scale using ball-milling techniques. The first series of testing investigate the development of flexible pavement using asphalt bituminous AC60/70 incorporated conventional and nano-crude oil fly ash waste. The percentage of conventional and nano-ash used in asphalt mixes was varied from 0 to 15% of asphalt binder. The use of nano-fly ash increases the rutting factor by 0%, 33%, 61% and 38% at 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% nano-fly ash content, respectively. The nano-fly ash improves the rutting factors and bearing load capacity of flexible pavement mixes more than the control mix and mixes containing conventional micro-fly ash. The second series of testing investigates the use of nano-fly ash in rigid pavement asphalt concrete. Conventional and nano-fly ash replaced cement content in concrete material at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%. Concrete material incorporated nano-fly ash shows higher compressive strength and lower absorption compared to concrete control sample and concrete containing conventional micro-fly ash. The strength of concrete incorporated nano-fly ash increases by 14.8%, while absorption of concrete improves by 20.1% at 10% nano-fly ash content. The optimum nano-fly ash content was 10% to achieve the highest performance of both pavement materials. The use of nano-crude oil fly ash improves the performance of both pavement materials and helps in reducing the cost of repair in road and highway construction. Moreover, the use of nano-fly ash in paving materials can help in the recycling of this toxic waste to produce sustainable and environmentally friendly road construction materials. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.","Asphalt pavement; Concrete; Conventional fly ash; Nano-fly ash, crude oil waste","Asphalt concrete; Asphalt pavements; Ball milling; Compressive strength; Concretes; Crude oil; Highway engineering; Milling (machining); Nanotechnology; Toxic materials; Concrete materials; Conventional fly ash; Flexible pavements; Fly ash content; Nano-fly ash, crude oil waste; Oil wastes; Pavement material; Performance; Rigid pavements; Rutting factor; Fly ash",,,,,"Yarmouk University, YU; King Khalid University, KKU","The authors thank several universities for helping and allowing the researchers to use the lab facilities including King Khalid University, Jadara University, and Yarmouk University.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Abuaddous, M., Dahim, M., Ismail, R., Taamneh, M., Alomari, A.H., Darwish, W., Al-Mattarneh, H., Sustainable asphalt concrete for road construction and building material (2021) IOP Conf Ser Earth Environ Sci, 801, p. 012023; (1991), ACI Committee 211.1, Standard practice for selecting proportions for normal, heavyweight and mass concrete.

The Er-added recycled glasses derived from CRT have been successfully fabricated as a component for Na2O–Al2O3–SiO2–K2O–CaO–SrO–BaO–PbO–Fe2O3–TiO2–Er2O3 glass systems. The waste cathode ray tube panel glass (WPG) series were obtained by inserting the Er2O3 in substitution for CRT in the amounts of 0, 1, 3 and 5 mol%. The synthesized WPG series were then subjected to numerous characterization analysis. One can firmly report that the insertion ratio from 0 to 5 mol% in Er2O3 increased the glass density from 2.9216 to 2.9763 g/cm3. Further, there exists no crystalline formation with the addition of Er2O3, instead, an amorphous nature in all WPG series emerges. Microstructural images captured by the SEM technique also confirm the non-crystallinity of the fabricated samples. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in SEM, besides, paved the way for revealing the elemental mapping of the WPG series. From the perspective of radiation shielding competencies, nuclear shielding features have been evaluated in terms of μm and related attenuation parameters at several photon energies of 276.4–1332.5 keV by utilizing narrow beam transmission methods. The experimental data have been also confirmed to those of theoretical results by WinXCom software. The HVL results revealed superior photon radiation shielding performances for recycled WPG glasses in comparison to various concretes. In addition, exposure buildup factor (EBF) values estimated utilizing the G-P fitting approach would be useful to design or develop the synthesized glass systems for shielding applications. Furthermore, the macroscopic effective removal cross-sections for fast neutron (ΣR) have been estimated. In conclusion, the findings clearly demonstrated that Er-incorporated CRT glasses can effectively be implemented in radiation shielding applications instead of Pb having toxic effects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","CRT glasses; Er2O3; HPGe detector; Radiation shielding; Waste valorization","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Barium compounds; Cathode ray tubes; Cathodes; Crystallinity; Electronic Waste; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Erbium compounds; Germanium compounds; Hematite; Lead oxide; Photons; Radiation shielding; Radioactivity; Recycling; Silica; Sodium compounds; Titanium dioxide; Cathode ray tube glass; Cathode-ray tube; Glass systems; Hazardous waste disposal; Hazardous waste management; HPGe detectors; Neutron shielding; Shielding applications; Synthesised; Waste valorizations; Glass",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Bing?l University, Central Laboratory Application and Research Center due to contributions in SEM and XRD analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kurtulus, R., Kavas, T., Akkurt, I., Gunoglu, K., An experimental study and WinXCom calculations on X-ray photon characteristics of Bi2O3-and Sb2O3-added waste soda-lime-silica glass (2020) Ceram.

Basic information on seven CDW landfills under operation or closed/abandoned was collected, and the waste composition and the grain size distributions of dumped CDW at two landfills were investigated. Results showed that only one landfill site is currently under operation in Hanoi. Sanitary conditions of investigated landfills were relatively good without dumping of hazardous waste. Illegal dumping of domestic waste from residents, however, could be observed more or less at all sites due to an unclear boundary between dumping and surrounding areas. To improve current management of CDW landfills, a suitable recording system of accepted/dumped CDW and technical support for site managers are required as well as the implementation plan for developing and renovating landfills. Based on the results of the waste composition survey, the major components of dumped CDW were “Concrete”, “Clay bricks”, and “Soil-like”, and the sum of these materials reached >80% of the total. Grain size distributions of “Concrete” ranged from 10–600 mm and of “Clay bricks” ranged from 10–300 mm. Technical recommendations to examine a potential availability of dumped “Concrete” and “Clay bricks” as a base material in road construction are summarized from the viewpoints of segregation from “Soil-like” and impurities, grading of “Concrete” and “Clay bricks”, mechanical properties and environmental safety, and economic feasibility. The findings in this study raise challenges and perspectives to establish sound CDW management and to promote sustainable development of CDW recycling in Vietnam. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there are serious downsides for the environment and health, which are becoming more and more stark in our society, and the recycling of plastic offers a partial solution to these widespread problems. The present work delves into the environmental assessment of fibre-reinforced concrete specimens, made with recycled plastic fibres from food packaging waste. Leaching tank tests for the evaluation of the long-term release of pollutant elements, identification of leaching mechanisms, and the diffusion process of contaminants into the environment were conducted on fibre reinforced concrete. The results showed that the incorporation of the recycled plastic fibres, classified as non-hazardous, did not release relevant levels of any potential harm-ful element incorporated in concrete. Moreover, low mobility was detected in the studied elements and different release mechanisms were identified through long-term diffusion leaching tests. Hence, the environmental feasibility of the incorporation of recycled plastic fibre in concrete was proven. This study strengthens the objectives set out by the Circular Economy Action Plan, which includes the European Strategy for Plastics and aims to, among other things, boost the market for recycled plastics. © 2021 by the authors.

Until now, this type of sludge has been used on agricultural land as fertilizer. What makes it reshaping its use in construction materials is that this sludge contains in addition organic elements and hazardous heavy metals that can be retained in the matrix of the concrete mixture. Thus, based on the experience of making mixtures of cathode glass with Pb, from the recycling of old monitors, it was observed that that the migration in time of Pb from the matrix of the material was below the limit imposed by current legislation. Failure to recover this sludge leads to long-term storage on large surfaces of land that will be contaminated or it will have to be stored on concrete or packed platforms, situation which increases the cost of disposal. The paper will present methods and results obtained in the research, which support the use of sludge from sewage treatment plants in dry granular form for strength concrete class C16/20 obtaining but with limited applicability. The final objective of the research is to provide a new alternative solution for the disposal and recovery of this hazardous waste. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Concrete industry; Concrete mixtures; Concrete products; Hazards; Heavy metals; Mixtures; Recovery; Sludge disposal; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Agricultural land; Alternative solutions; Cost of disposal; Hazardous heavy metals; Long-term storage; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Resistance class; Treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Johnson, O A, Napiah, M, Kamaruddin, I, (2014) Res.

The ferronickel slag (FNS) as an industrial by-product and recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) derived from construction and demolition wastes have potential for sustainable use as the fine and coarse aggregate in concrete, respectively. However, less information regarding the re-utilization of FNS as fine aggregate in recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) and the effects on transport properties can be found in the previous literature. The aim of this study is to investigate the compressive strength and transport behavior of RAC incorporating FNS as fine aggregate. In this study, several groups of specimens with different replacement ratios of FNS as fine aggregate (0, 20%, 40% and 50%) and RCAs (0, 50% and 100%) as coarse aggregate were prepared. The compressive strengths of FNS-RAC specimens at curing age of 3, 7 and 28 days were measured. The coupled effects of FNS and RCAs on the resistance to water absorption and chloride penetration of concrete were discussed. To explore the effect of microstructure on transport behavior, the tests of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were further conducted. Overall, the sorptivity and chloride diffusion coefficient increase as the RCA replacement ratio increases, but they generally decrease with increasing of FNS content. The mixtures containing 40%–50% FNS fine aggregate in RAC exhibit the greater compressive strength and better resistance to transport behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compressive strength; Ferronickel slag; Recycled aggregate concrete; Replacement ratio; Transport behavior","Chlorine compounds; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Demolition; Ferroalloys; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectrometers; Transport properties; Water absorption; Coarse aggregates; Ferronickel; Ferronickel slag; Fine aggregates; Potential threats; Property; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled concrete aggregates; Replacement ratio; Transport behavior; Slags",,,,,"A2020-007; Department of Education of Shandong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51778309, 51908307, 51922052, 51978353, U1706222; Dalian University of Technology, DUT: LP1902; State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, SLCOE","Financial support of ongoing projects by Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51908307 , 51922052 , U1706222 , 51778309 , 51978353 ), first−class discipline project funded by the Education Department of Shandong Province , Postdoctoral Applied Research Project of Qingdao City in China ( A2020-007 ) and open fund projects of State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering by Dalian University of Technology ( LP1902 ) are greatly acknowledged.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bao, J., Li, S., Zhang, P., Ding, X., Xue, S., Cui, Y., Zhao, T., Influence of the incorporation of recycled coarse aggregate on water absorption and chloride penetration into concrete (2020) Construct.

Previous investigations demonstrated that such activated fines can stabilize the whole mixture thereby improving its mechanical properties. To comprehensively investigate the behaviour of the activated fine, its strength and leaching properties under different curing temperatures were compared to those of the four alkali-activated powders of CDW aggregate constituents (concrete, reclaimed asphalt, bricks and tiles, and natural aggregate). Flexural and compressive strength tests at 28 days of curing were performed on different pastes prepared with different liquid to solid (l/s) mass ratios (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), and cured at 5, 20, 40, and 80 °C. All components showed satisfactory strength properties for l/s = 0.4, which was found to be optimal. A significant enhancement of the mechanical properties was observed for specimens treated at 80 °C. However, non-negligible strength values were obtained at other temperatures. In particular, the undivided fractions showed satisfactory results and a low variability in properties when cured at average roadside temperatures from − 5 to 40 °C. Following leaching tests, the environmental compatibility of alkali-activated materials was deemed satisfactory with the concentration of pollutants considerably below the threshold of the European Council Decision 2003/33/EC for non-hazardous waste. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali-activation; Construction and demolition waste; Leaching; Mechanical properties; Stabilization","Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Curing; Demolition; Recycling; Stabilization; Alkali activation; Alkali-activated; Construction and demolition waste; Curing temperature; Development assessments; Environmental assessment; Mechanical; Property; Strength development; Waste aggregates; Leaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017), http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics, Eurostat, Waste statistics - Statistics Explained; Jiménez, J.R., (2013), pp. 351-377. , https://doi.org/10.1533/9780857096906.3.351, Recycled aggregates (RAs) for roads, in: Handbook of Recycled Concrete and Demolition Waste, Elsevier; Cristelo, N., Vieira, C.S., de Lurdes Lopes, M., Geotechnical and geoenvironmental assessment of recycled construction and demolition waste for road embankments (2016) Procedia Eng., 143, pp. 51-58; de Brito, J., Pereira, A.S., Correia, J.R., Mechanical behaviour of non-structural concrete made with recycled ceramic aggregates (2005) Cem.

Ankawa, Erbil, KR, Iraq","Increase in construction activities leads to increased consumption of natural aggregates resources used in concrete and increased quantity of generated construction and demolishing wastes that are hazardous for the environment. Being a developing country that had faced wars and that owns numerous aged and damaged buildings, North Cyprus still lacks facilities for processing construction and demolishing wastes in the form of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). Initiation of practices in North Cyprus on RCA-concrete can be promoted if the performance of new concretes including local RCA are proven to be successful. Additionally, previous international studies on the use of recycled concrete aggregates have been observed to lack in covering certain critical aspects such as employing high contents of not laboratory-made but real and damaged RCA having known source and age information and without other waste impurities in the manufacture of high-strength concrete mixes. This case study presents results of experimental investigations that are carried out for the first time on the performance of RCA that has aged in North Cyprus, while providing detailed experimental data covering the mentioned missing aspects in the literature. The results have shown that with 100% replacement of quarried aggregates with recycled aggregates, 0.711-m cube of demolishing waste could be eliminated per each meter cube of new concrete while saving that quantity of quarried aggregates at the same time. The new concrete produced with this high waste content has been observed to reach up to significantly high strength values as 49 MPa within 90 days, as an indicator of a successful performance. Hence, the work confirms the use of recycled concrete aggregates as an efficient and viable environmental-friendly method to preserve aggregate resources in North Cyprus while reducing demolishing wastes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Compressive strength;

Box 513, Eindhoven, 5600MB, Netherlands","The converter steel slag is a by-product during the steel-making process, which usually acts as an inert ingredient in construction due to the relatively low reactivity. However, its mineral composition results in a high reactivity in a CO2 rich environment. This study reveals the modification of converter steel slag by an ambient CO2 pretreatment, and the application of modified converter steel slag as the supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in the design of eco-friendly ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) by using a particle packing model. The results show that converter steel slag after ambient CO2 pretreatment is feasible to be used in eco-friendly UHPC design, which achieves a relative higher compressive strength over 150 MPa with the cement substitution from 15% to 45%, compared to non-carbonated steel slag. The ambient CO2 pretreatment can modify the physical and chemical properties of converter steel slag particles, which produces a rough and porous surface of slag particles because of the precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous silica gel as carbonation products. Consequently, the incorporation of carbonated steel slag improves the cement hydration, enhance the formation of ettringite and C-S-H, while densify the microstructure compared to non-carbonated slag in eco-friendly UHPCs. The leaching of potentially hazardous elements, e.g. Cr and V from carbonated steel slag can be efficiently reduced below legal limits in UHPC mixtures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ambient carbonation; Converter steel slag; Pozzolanic reaction; Recycling; Ultra-high performance concrete","Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Cements; Chromium compounds; Compressive strength; Environmental protection; Hydration; Precipitation (chemical); Silica; Silica gel; Slags; Steelmaking; Cement hydration; Converter steel slags; Mineral composition; Physical and chemical properties; Potentially hazardous elements; Steelmaking process; Supplementary cementitious material; Ultra high performance concretes (UHPC); Ultra-high performance concrete",,,,,"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, TU/e; China Scholarship Council, CSC: 201606300062; Tata Steel","This research was supported by the funding of China Scholarship Council (No. 201606300062) and Eindhoven University of Technology.

With the improvement of the quality of life, electronic and electrical equipment, resulting in the continuous shortening of the life of electronic and electrical equipment, and the speed of upgrading with the improvement of life quality, people are gradually pursuing the multi-function and portability of EEE, which resulted in that the service life of EEE is shorten continually and the speed of replacement is accelerated. The number of waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE) in the world is growing at an alarming rate. The composition of WEEE is very complex containing a variety of metal elements and harmful substances, which make it be both an opportunity and a challenge for resource recovery and environmental protection. As the main component of WEEE, waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs), which contain a variety of metal elements whose content is higher than the corresponding mineral products, have high reco-very value. Due to the high economic value, the recycling of metal materials has attracted worldwide attention. Many researches have explored many efficient and environmental friendly methods to recycle metal materials. At present, the recycling technologies of metal materials have been very mature. However, the non-metal materials, which accounts for a large proportion in WPCBs, are often neglected due to the low economic value. The common recycling techniques of non-metal materials are incineration or landfill. The non-metal material contains heavy metals, brominated flame retardants and other harmful substances, toxic gases such as dioxins, polybrominated diphenyls and dibenzofurans would be produced during the incineration process. In addition, landfill will lead to secondary groundwater pollution because of the leaching of heavy metals and brominated flame retardants. With the increasing of environmental awareness, the recycling of non-metal materials has attracted more and more attention to avoid resources waste and environmental pollution. At present, a lot of researches have been done to recover non-metal mate-rials from WPCBs. At this paper, the technologies and current situation of non-metal materials recycling are elaborated based on the existing researches. And the future trend of non-metal materials recycling is also discussed. At present, the methods of non-metal materials recovery include physical recovery methods and chemical recovery methods, which could recover and utilize the non-metal materials effectively. The phy-sical methods use the separated non-metallic materials as fillers, raw materials or modifiers to produce thermosetting resin matrix composites and thermoplastic resin matrix composites, concrete and viscoelastic materials. These methods could change the properties of materials and reduce the production cost of the materials by replacing the original materials using non-metal materials. Chemical recovery methods mainly include pyrolysis, liquid depolymerization and hydrogenation degradation. Among them, the pyrolysis recovery method has received more attention than other methods. Much work needs to be done on the recovery of non-metal materials by liquid depolymerization and hydrogenation degradation. This paper summarizes and compares the advantages and problems of various methods based on cost and environmental impact. And a reference is provided for the future development trend of non-metal materials recycling. © 2021, Materials Review Magazine.

This paper focuses on the possibility of application of discarded cathode ray tube (CRT) glass inside a metakaolin-based geopolymer in the form of an aggregate, providing an ecological method of recycling of this hazardous material. The main goal of this paper was to develop an optimal composition of a new geopolymer and to describe its behavior under varying curing conditions. A geopolymer made of different mixtures was subjected to flexural and compressive strength tests. The density, mass loss, temperature changes, and metals leaching were determined as well. The results demonstrated that neither the content of CRT glass nor the curing regime has a significant influence on the mechanical behavior. However, the strength of the geopolymer containing 50% CRT glass by mass increased with time in contrast to a geopolymer with a higher CRT glass content. The development of temperature inside the mixture was dependent on the amount of metakaolin. The concentration of toxic metals in an aqueous extract decreased considerably after the encapsulation of CRT glass inside the geopolymer. The presented results indicate that discarded CRT glass can be considered an aggregate for a metakaolin-based geopolymer. The new material shows high strength and makes the CRT glass safe for the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

A typical management option for ladle slag is stockpiling in open yards. Given the massive production quantities of such material, this disposal mechanism has posed major environmental concerns over the years. The construction industry is a potential area that may recycle ladle slag as a sustainable replacement to cement binder, thereby reducing the consumption of cement, conserving natural resources, and alleviating greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, this paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the generation, characteristics, and reaction mechanisms of ladle slag. The effect of utilizing ladle slag on the fresh and hardened properties and microstructure of alkali-activated mortar and cement-based conventional and self-compacting concrete is also reviewed. Findings highlighted that utilizing ladle slag by the concrete industry is possible with favorable properties when certain preprocessing measurements, such as milling, sieving, and gypsum addition, are implemented. Furthermore, it is concluded that the degree of reaction and performance of alkali-activated mortar and concrete are dependent on the curing temperature and the type and components of the alkaline activator solution. Also, the replacement of 20% cement with ladle slag does not compromise the strength and durability aspects of cement-based concrete. From an environmental perspective, ladle slag is considered a non-hazardous material suitable for use in construction applications. The research gaps in the existing knowledge and future research directions are also identified. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali-activation; Cement replacement; Environmental impact; Ladle slag; Performance evaluation; Waste recycling","Cement industry; Cements; Concrete industry; Conservation; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mortar; Self compacting concrete; Slags; Alkali-activated mortars; Alkaline activators; Construction applications; Environmental concerns; Fresh and hardened properties; Future research directions; Management options; State-of-the art reviews; Ladles",,,,,"United Arab Emirates University, UAEU: 31N322","This work was supported by the United Arab Emirates University [grant number 31N322 ].",,,,,,,,,,,,"Adesanya, E., Ohenoja, K., Kinnunen, P., Illikainen, M., Alkali activation of ladle slag from steel-making process (2017) J.

The black pollution created by this obstinately biodegradable waste poses a potential threat to environment. Scrap tires in landfills, scrap zones have direct effect on human health, contaminating soil and ground water due to the leaching effect of toxic metals present in tires. Concrete being the second most consumed material in the world, with 3 tons per year used for every person, partial incorporation of discarded tire into concrete, as aggregates, is an effective way of immobilizing waste, especially when 60–75% of concrete is made of aggregates. The main aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of utilizing shredded tire in concrete for structures and pavements through critical review of its rheological, static/dynamic mechanical, durability properties. Besides the study also envisages to explore different treatments, modifications and compositions for optimum utility of tire incorporated concrete/composites. The manuscript also intends to update the data base of shredded tire concrete/composites for further experimental and numerical investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crumb rubber; Flexibility; Impact resistant concrete; Pavement; Rubber aggregates; Rubber chip; Rubber recycling; Rubberized concrete; Shredded tires","Aggregates; Concrete aggregates; Groundwater; Tires; Biodegradable wastes; Cementitious composites; Critical review; Different treatments; Durability property; Numerical investigations; Partial incorporation; Potential threats; Concretes",,,,,"King Abdulaziz University, KAU: G-640-135-38; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdulaziz University , Jeddah, under grant no.

In this study, a novel precipitant, N,N′-Bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)thiourea, was developed for the selective removal of F(-I) from strongly acidic wastewater. The precipitant was synthesized using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and thiourea at a molar ratio of 2:1 under 160 ℃. More than 90% of initial F(-I) was removed by the prepared precipitant from strong acidic wastewater produced by nonferrous metal smelting industry, and the residual F(-I) concentration decreased to below 100 mg/L. The F(-I) removal performance is almost free from the interference of coexisting ions. Only 6 kg/m3 of fluoride slag, which can be recycled as a concrete waterproofing agent, was produced. The F(-I) removal mechanism including substitution, polycondensation, ion exchange and complexation was clarified: ‒OH on Si atoms in the hydrolysis product of BTPT was substituted by F(-I), and a fluoro-substituted product formed; the polycondensation of BTPT and fluoro-substituted product produced polymer precipitates; the specific adsorption of F(-I) on the polymer precipitates occurred through ion exchange with ‒OH and complexation with -NH2+-. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fluoride; Organosilicon; Polycondensation; Strongly acidic wastewater; Substitution","Fluorine compounds; Ions; Lime; Molar ratio; Polycondensation; Slags; Thioureas; Environmental risks; Hazardous solid waste; Hydrolysis products; Removal mechanism; Removal performance; Smelting industry; Specific adsorption; Substituted products; Ion exchange; copper; deionized water; fluoride ion; n,n' bis(3 (triethoxysilyl)propyl)thiourea; nickel; thiourea derivative; unclassified drug; zinc; anion; efficiency measurement; fluoride; ion exchange; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; analysis; Article; chemical reaction; complex formation; heating; hydrolysis; ion exchange; polycondensation; precipitation; recycling; smelting; strongly acidic wastewater; synthesis; waste water; waste water management; X ray photoemission spectroscopy",,"copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; nickel, 7440-02-0; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 21976192, 21976195; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS: 19Z04ESPCR; State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 21976192, 21976195 ] and the special fund from the State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control (Research Center for Eco-environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences ) [grant number 19Z04ESPCR ].",,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, K., Znad, H., Awual, M.R., A ligand anchored conjugate adsorbent for effective mercury(II) detection and removal from aqueous media (2018) Chem.

Because, the epoxy resin is an expensive building material, this study presents research on reducing its mass needed to make a floor coating, through the use of waste limestone powder as a filler. This additionally supports the recycling of the mineral waste. The main aim of the research was to find the amount of waste limestone powder that would not adversely affect the adhesive properties of the epoxy resin coating. The tests were carried out on a concrete element, with two differently prepared substrate surfaces using grinding and left raw after concreting. The epoxy resin coating contained waste limestone powder in an amount of 0 to 29% was examined. The pull-off strength of the coating was examined at three points for each coating composition on both types of the surfaces. The aim of the research was achieved by obtaining the satisfactory results of the pull-off strength for epoxy resin filled with the waste limestone powder.

The global demand for cement production has been increasing. One ton of cement releases about one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Also, after freshwater, sand is considered the second natural resource that is consumed. Due to the limited sand resources and the concerns around the environmental issues of cement production, in this study, the use of waste foundry sand (WFS) as an alternative to aggregate in slag-based geopolymer mortars as an alternative to cement has been considered. WFS is a by-product of the foundry industry, which is produced in large quantities and buried in landfills, and slag is the by-product of iron and steel making process which is highly cementitious and high in calcium silicate hydrates (CSH). In this study, the mechanical, durability properties, and environmental assessment of geopolymer mortars using WFS were investigated. The results show that the compressive strength of geopolymer mortars containing treated WFS at the age of 91 days had an increase of 158% compared to cement-based mortars. The adhesion and flexural strength in geopolymer mortars containing treated WFS compared to untreated mortars increased by 145% and 18%, respectively. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) results showed that the concentration of heavy metals in the leachate WFS, mortars containing treated and untreated WFS, and ground granulated blast-furnace (GGBF) slag was within the standard permitted limitations and WFS is not a hazardous waste. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Concrete technology; Geopolymer; Recycle; TCLP; ICP-MS; Waste foundry sand (WFS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alapour, F., (2012) Feasibility of Producing Geopolymer Mortars Using Supplementary Cementitious Materials, , Master Thesis, Amirkabir University of Technology; (2015) C596:Standard Test Method for Drying Shrinkage of Mortar Containing Hydraulic cement”,Annual Book of ASTM Standard,American Society for Testing and Materials, , USA; (2008) ASTM C109""Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Hydraulic Cement Mortars (Using 2-In.

Many countries have travertine mine where travertine cutting wastes are generated. Since these wastes are hazardous for the environment, it is inevitable to come up with a solution for this problem. So, aim of this study is to find a way to remove the waste and adding economic value. Travertine wastes were obtained from the waste site, then transported to a quarry and crushed in different sizes up to 25 mm for using as aggregate in concrete. In addition to travertine waste aggregates, limestone and basalt aggregates were used and characterised by standard tests using for the determination of the physical and mechanical properties of aggregates. Compressive and splitting tensile strengths, modulus of elasticity measurements, wear resistance, capillary permeability, alkali-silica reactivity and freezing and thawing tests were performed on the concretes. Besides mechanical and durability tests, micro and macro structural examinations were performed to investigate the matrix-aggregate interface. Test results showed that concretes with a compressive strength of 30–60 MPa could be obtained using travertine waste aggregate. Additionally, these concretes can be durable against frost and alkali-silica actions compared to limestone and basalt aggregates. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aggregate; concrete; environmental pollution; travertine; Waste recycling","Calcium carbonate; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Durability; Fillers; Groundwater; Lime; Precipitation (chemical); Silica; Tensile strength; Basalt aggregates; Condition; Different sizes; Economic values; Environmental pollutions; Limestone aggregates; Performance assessment; Waste aggregates; Waste sites; Wastes recycling; Limestone",,,,,,"Authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support with project # 6601a-FBE/20-398 provided by Yozgat Bozok University Project Coordination Application and Research Center.",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2019) 318-19 Building code requirements for structural concrete and commentary; Arioglu, N., Canan Girgin, Z., Arioglu, E., Evaluation of ratio between splitting tensile strength and compressive strength for concretes up to 120 MPa and its application in strength criterion (2006) ACI Materials Journal, 103 (1), pp. 18-24; Standard test method for measurement of rate of absorption of water by hydraulic cement concretes (2013) ASTM International, 41 (147), pp. 1-6. , https://doi.org/10.1520/C1585-20; Behera, M., Bhattacharyya, S.K., Minocha, A.K., Deoliya, R., Maiti, S., Recycled aggregate from C&D waste & its use in concrete–a breakthrough towards sustainability in construction sector: A review (2014) Construction and Building Materials, 68, pp. 501-516; Biró, A., Hlavička, V., Lublóy, É., Effect of fire-related temperatures on natural stones (2019) Construction and Building Materials, 212, pp. 92-101; Cobanoglu, I., Celik, S.B., Cam, O., Etiz, H., Kursun, M., Investigation of the usability of travertine quarry wastes as concrete aggregate (2014) Pamukkale University Journal of Engineering Sciences, 20 (3), pp. 92-99; Cobanoğlu, İ., Celik, S.B., Assessments on the usability of Wide Wheel (Capon) test as reference abrasion test method for building stones (2017) Construction and Building Materials, 151, pp. 319-330; Corinaldesi, V., Mechanical and elastic behaviour of concretes made of recycled-concrete coarse aggregates (2010) Construction and Building Materials, 24 (9), pp. 1616-1620; Dash, M.K., Patro, S.K., Performance assessment of ferrochrome slag as partial replacement of fine aggregate in concrete (2021) European Journal of Environmental and Civil Engineering, 25 (4), pp. 635-654; Demirdag, S., Effects of freezing-thawing and thermal shock cycles on physical and mechanical properties of filled and unfilled travertines (2013) Construction and Building Materials, 47, pp. 1395-1401; Dovì, V.G., Friedler, F., Huisingh, D., Klemeš, J.J., Cleaner energy for sustainable future (2009) Journal of Cleaner Production, 17 (10), pp. 889-895; (2002), Testing of concretehardened concreteproducing fluorescence impregnated thin sections, Danish Standard; (2020), Tests for mechanical and physical properties of aggregates.

The present study investigated the potential of utilising Jarosite as a partial substitute for Portland cement in two separate series of concrete mixtures to be used for preparing concrete blocks and conventional concrete pavements. Processed (finely powdered) Jarosite waste was substituted for Portland cement up to 25% at certain proportions of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% in concrete mixtures and tested for fresh, mechanical, durability, and microstructure properties. Based on laboratory test results and analyses, the increase in proportion of Jarosite up to 15% improved the mechanical properties of concrete mixtures, thereafter decreasing to some extent. Meanwhile, the durability characteristics of concrete mixtures demonstrated continuous improvement with an increase in Jarosite proportion up to 25%. Microstructural investigation revealed denser pore structure and improved transition zone characteristics for Jarosite concrete, which may have resulted from the filler effect and pozzolanic activity of finely powdered Jarosite waste, thereby contributing to its better performance compared to the control concrete mixture. It was also observed that Jarosite-added concrete becomes more vulnerable to acid attack at higher Jarosite substitution levels due to delayed ettringite formation. Furthermore, the heavy metal leachability of Jarosite concrete mixtures predicted from leaching test data for similar classes of concrete confirmed their environmental suitability. Therefore, an optimum Jarosite incorporation level of 15% may be conservatively recommended for concrete blocks (medium-traffic application) and conventional concrete pavements based on the criterion of strength enhancement or concreting application in an aggressive environment while using Jarosite as Portland cement substitute. Otherwise, higher substitution levels of Jarosite up to 25% may be used without compromising the desired engineering properties for pavement applications in the road sector. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.","Concrete mixture;

Thanks to new technologies, the waste is disinfected for being discarded as non-hazardous waste, incinerated or landfilled, making the disinfection process redundant and increasing the disposal costs. This study takes advantage of BPW to improve water sorptivity and electrical resistivity of concrete and lightens the way towards environmental-friendly disposal of BPW. Three Hybrid, Soft, and Hard BPW were added to concrete from 0% to 9% by weight of cement in 13 different mixtures. Afterwards, electrical resistivity, long-term capillary water absorption tests were conducted. Predictive models were then developed in three time periods. The addition of Hybrid and Hard BPW improved the capillary absorption and sorptivity by 28%, but, surprisingly, Soft BPW addition showed an adverse effect. Electrical resistivity also improved up to 22.1% after BPW addition. Considering the results, utilising Hybrid BPW in concrete eliminates the waste separating phase and can improve the concrete’s durability, saving time and costs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biomedical polymeric waste recycling; concrete durability; electrical resistivity; predictive modelling; sorptivity","Capillary flow; Concrete mixtures; Dialysis; Electric conductivity; Functional polymers; Polymer concrete; Predictive analytics; Waste disposal; Water absorption; Capillary absorption; Capillary water absorption; Disinfection process; Environmental-friendly; Non hazardous wastes; Polymeric waste; Predictive models; Water sorptivity; Waste treatment",,,,,"Fresenius Medical Care North America, FMCNA","Authors gratefully acknowledge Prof. John Agar (Barwon Health), Dr Katherine Barraclough (Melbourne Health), Mr Richard Knight (Barwon Health), Dr Susan Blair, and Fresenius Medical Care support for providing the BPW.

Recycled plastic collected from a local recycling company in the state of Victoria, Australia were tested to evaluate any potential contaminant leaching from such material to the surrounding environment. Leaching tests were conducted for 238 potential contaminants following Australian Standard Leaching Procedure (ASLP) using pH-neutral water. From the series of leaching test results, it is clear that concentrations of all the assessed contaminants, except Lead in the tested samples, are either below their individual detection limits or below the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Victoria defined limits to label these materials as hazardous. Apart from one pollutant, the material is safe to be reused for different engineering applications. In addition, a carbon footprint analysis was conducted considering a sustainable approach of using such recycled plastic with recycled concrete and recycled glass. It is found that through using such recycled materials total carbon footprint savings for 1 km railway track ballast material would be up to 52,211 kg CO2e. Finally, a cost analysis is presented to demonstrate economic benefit of using recycled plastic. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon footprint; ground improvement; pavements; Plastics; railways; recycled materials","Ballast (railroad track); Carbon footprint; Chemical detection; Concrete aggregates; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Leaching; Plastics industry; Railroads; Australian standards; Engineering applications; Leaching procedures; Potential contaminants; Railway applications; Recycling companies; Surrounding environment; Victoria , Australia; Plastic recycling",,,,,"IC170100006; Sustainability Victoria, SV: C-11569","This research project was funded by Sustainability Victoria (Contract ID: C-11569) in partnership with Metro Trains Melbourne, Rail Projects Victoria and the Level Crossing Removal Projects.

This study investigated how WTE BA form is changed after the hydration and the impacts of WTE BA hydration on its leaching characteristics by using geometrical and leaching tests when incorporated in cement matrix for the recycling. The material composition and characteristics of anhydrous BA, hydrated BA, cement paste, Portland cement concrete (PCC), and BA-combined PCC were evaluated through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses. The results confirmed that the WTE BA newly formed a complex phase of hydration products in a cement matrix. Synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) test was also conducted to investigate the leaching behaviors of alkaline components and metals of BA in the crushed BA-PCC samples. Through the leaching study, the leachability of crushed BA-combined concrete was rigorously evaluated when recycled as construction materials (e.g. base, subbase, subdrainage, etc.), which is the worst–case scenario. The results revealed that the release of highly alkaline elements increases with increasing BA content. However, the release of trace metals was reduced by 20-30% significantly when mixed properly with Portland cement concrete (PCC), which is due to both physical and chemical binding in cement hydration products. In addition, the thresholds of water regulations, set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States, were assessed as the basis for evaluating the extent of the risk of the leaching of toxic materials. Implications: This study investigated how waste to energy (WTE) bottom ash (BA) form is changed after the hydration and the impacts of WTE BA hydration on its environmental leaching characteristics by using geometrical and leaching tests when incorporated in cement matrix for the recycling. Incorporating of WTE BA in cement mixture can form new mineralogical phases of hydration products in cement matrices such as Copper Hydrogen Arsenate Hydrate and Jahnsite. A significant reduction of alkaline elements (Si, Al, and K) from crushed PCC mixed with WTE BA due to the hydration. The lowest concentrations of major alkaline elements leached from the crushed PCC containing either 10% or 20% of BA contents. The averaged leaching concentration of detected elements is substantially below the water quality guidelines (provided by U.S. EPA and WHO) except Al. © 2021 A&WMA.",,"Alkalinity; Aluminum compounds; Arsenate minerals; Ash handling; Ashes; Cement industry; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Health risks; Hydration; Leaching; Portland cement; Recycling; Risk assessment; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon compounds; Toxic materials; Trace elements; Waste incineration; Water quality; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray spectroscopy; Experimental assessment; Leaching characteristics; Leaching concentrations; Material compositions; Portland cement concretes; Synthetic precipitation leaching procedures; Water quality guidelines; World Health Organization; Concretes; aluminum; arsenic acid derivative; cement; concrete; potassium; silicon; trace metal; water; bottom ash; chemical binding; concentration (parameter); controlled study; hydration; leaching; recycling; scanning electron microscopy; United States; waste-to-energy; water quality; World Health Organization; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; building material; fly ash; incineration; solid waste; Coal Ash; Construction Materials; Incineration; Recycling; Solid Waste",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; potassium, 7440-09-7; silicon, 7440-21-3; water, 7732-18-5; Coal Ash; Solid Waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Fly ash facts for highway engineers; Al Muhit, B.A., An, J., Nam, B.H., Recycling of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) ash as aggregate replacement in concrete (2015) IFCEE 2015, , San Antonio, Texas; Al-Abed, S.R., Jegadeesan, G., Purandare, J., Allen, D., Leaching behavior of mineral processing waste: Comparison of batch and column investigations (2008) J.

However, blending some types of debris may not produce the desired results in all soils. Concrete diamond-grinding work on pavement projects generates a non-hazardous waste by-product called concrete grinding residue (or CGR). CGR has known cementitious characteristics that suggest a latent use as a soil-stabilizing amendment, especially for poor and problematic soils. In this study, Western Iowa loess soil was amended with CGR and subjected to rainfall simulations to measure the erodibility of several soil mixtures. To evaluate rain erosivity at different rainfall intensities, simulated rainfall experiments were performed on CGR-Amended soils at 20% CGR dosages. This study reviewed different methods for collecting CGR discharge, discussed design, construction, and use of a uniform compaction apparatus; and analyzed stormwater runoff from soil forms tested in an indoor rainfall simulator. Pre-rainfall investigation of CGR-Amended soils included standard Proctor compaction tests. Post-rainfall analysis included turbidity and total suspended-solids tests. Standard Proctor tests found the CGR-Amended loess had only slightly different optimum moisture contents (OMCs) and maximum dry densities (MDDs) compared to untreated loess, while lab tests on rainwater runoff samples on CGR-Amended loess exhibited dramatically higher turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS). Turbidity for CGR-Amended loess increased from 2.5 to 7.5 times that of the loess (control) soil, while TSS increased from 1.8 to 4.7 times that of the control soil. Future lab-based wind simulations will be performed on CGR-Amended soils to evaluate wind erosivity due to ""wind whip"" from passing vehicles. Additional Class A-1 highway shoulder soils will be tested for wind erodibility at several CGR dosages in lab-based simulations, and pre-and post-soil bearing strength and soil loss measurements will be used to evaluate the effects of CGR dosages on each shoulder aggregate. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

This research evaluates possible and suitable recycling of WCBPD as a partial replacement of Portland cement in the production of the rapidly expanding roller compacted concrete (RCC). This experimental work aims to test the influence of using different proportions (10, 20, 30, and 40%) of WCBPD on the mechanical performance and durability of RCC subjected to sulphate attack. The investigation included compressive strength, a non-destructive test (ultrasonic pulse velocity), water absorption coefficient, and the sulphate linear expansion test. The experimental results were promising for recycling WCBPD as fractions of Portland cement in RCC mixtures at small amounts. Compared to reference cylinders, the reduction in compression strength was about 10, 28, 32 and 39% for 10, 20, 30 and 40% WCBPD replacement ratios, respectively. All RCC mixtures showed satisfactory sulphate resistance since no significant loss in compressive strength nor a significant increase in expansion ratio occurred due to sulphate exposure. The reductions in compressive strength at 180 days of sulphate exposure were 12.8, 15.6, 15.9, 16.1 and 16.6% for RCC cylinders prepared with WCBPD partial replacements of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%, respectively. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","compressive strength; recycling; Roller compacted concrete; sulphate resistance of concrete; white cement bypass dust","Cement industry; Compressive strength; Concrete industry; Cylinders (shapes); Durability; Dust; Expansion; Mixtures; Nondestructive examination; Portland cement; Recycling; Rollers (machine components); Sulfur compounds; Ultrasonic testing; Waste disposal; Water absorption; Compression strength; Different proportions; Environmental concerns; Mechanical performance; Non-destructive test; Partial replacement; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; Water absorption coefficient; Roller compacted concrete",,,,,"Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan, ZUJ: 20/18/2018-2019","The authors would like to acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research at Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan for their financial support (Award No. 20/18/2018-2019) and the technical support provided by the laboratories of the Department of Civil and Infrastructure Engineering within the university.",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2001), Report on Roller-Compacted Concrete Pavements.

It is becoming imperative to investigate more sustainable and large-scale opportunities for the reuse of ELTs. One novel engineering solution is their reuse in structures with enhanced seismic resilience. This is particularly important in countries such as New Zealand and Japan where past earthquakes have caused widespread damage and socioeconomic loss. Research is being carried out to investigate a seismic-resilient engineered foundation-soil system for low-to-medium-density low-rise residential housing composed of a layer of granulated tire rubber (GTR) and gravel, and a flexible rubber–concrete raft foundation. It is essential to ensure that such innovations do not result in long-term negative impacts on the environment as tires contain hazardous compounds used in their manufacturing and the steel fiber within the tires can leach heavy metals (e.g., zinc, manganese, lead, cadmium). Preliminary batch leaching tests undertaken on (1) GTR and (2) GTR: gravel mixtures (20–40% rubber content by volume) indicated leaching of calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) which was contributed to the gravel and low levels of zinc (Zn), which were attributed to the tires. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","End-of-life tires; Foundation systems; Tire leachate; Waste tires","Earthquake engineering; Gravel; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Health risks; Heavy metals; Housing; Leaching; Public health; Seismology; Steel fibers; Surface waters; Tires; Zinc; Engineering solutions; Environmental implications; Foundation systems; Hazardous compounds; Residential housings; Seismic resilience; Socioeconomic loss; Widespread damage; Sustainable development",,,,,"University of Canterbury, UC; Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, MBIE: 56289","The authors are grateful for the research support provided by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment of NZ (MBIE Smart Ideas Research Grant No. 56289).

Marble is the metamorphic form of limestone (CaCO3) and WMP was chosen as substitute of cement on account of its high calcium oxide content. WMP is by-product of marble industry and is an environmental burden. The manufacturing of cement is also environmentally hazardous owing to emission of greenhouse gases. Thus, the recycling of WMP in place of cement in concrete offers two ecological advantages. Thirdly, WMP has a specific gravity of 2.6 against that of 3.15 for cement, which reduces the weight of the finished products. Based on the previous studies, five different concrete mixes were prepared having 0, 5, 10, 15 and 15% replacement levels. The samples were evaluated both through destructive and non-destructive tests. Destructive tests included compressive, tensile and flexural strengths, whereas non-destructive tests comprised of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) and rebound hammer. It was observed that the workability decreases with WMP inclusion owing to its higher water absorption, which inhibits lubrication of cement particles. The concrete strength improves up to a replacement level of 10% by mass of cement on account of densification created by the finer WMP and un-hydrated cement particles, which act as hard inclusions. Beyond 10%, the concrete strength starts declining due to insufficient quantity of cement matrix, binding the WMP particles. Schmidt rebound numbers authenticate the compressive strength results: The number increases up to 10% replacement level and beyond 10% it decreases. The results of UPV indicate that the velocity increases with increase in WMP content: The increase is attributed to compactness of the composite with finer WMP particles. © 2021 by the authors.","Cement; Concrete; Destructive testing; Non-destructive testing; Optimum value; Waste marble powder",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gupta, Monika Shekhar, Sustainable Concrete Production through Use of Marble Powder as Partial Replacement of Cement in Concrete Mix (2017) International Journal of Engineering Science and Computing, pp. 15505-15507; Şahan Arel, Hasan, Recyclability of Waste Marble in Concrete Production (2016) Journal of Cleaner Production, 131, pp. 179-188. , (September); Jalil, Affan, Khitab, Anwar, Ishtiaq, Hamza, Bukhari, Syed Hassan, Arshad, Muhammad Tausif, Anwar, Waqas, Evaluation of Steel Industrial Slag as Partial Replacement of Cement in Concrete (2019) Civil Engineering Journal, 5 (1), p. 181. , (January 27); Khan, Raja Bilal Nasar, Khitab, Anwar, Enhancing Physical, Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Rubberized Concrete (2020) Engineering and Technology Quarterly Reviews, 3 (1), pp. 33-45; Munir, Muhammad Junaid, Kazmi, Syed Minhaj Saleem, Khitab, Anwar, Hassan, Muhammad, Utilization of rice husk ash to mitigate alkali silica reaction in concrete (2016) Proceedings of 2nd International Multi-disciplinary Conference, 19, p. 20; Abubakr, M., Khitab, A., Sadiq, S., Anwar, W., Tayyeb, S., Evaluation of Ordinary Concrete Having Ceramic Waste Powder as Partial Replacement of Cement (2019) International Conference on Sustainable Development, pp. 1-4. , Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Jamshoro, Pakistan; Kore, Sudarshan D., Vyas, A.K., Impact of Marble Waste as Coarse Aggregate on Properties of Lean Cement Concrete (2016) Case Studies in Construction Materials, 4, pp. 85-92. , (June); Khitab, A., Anwar, W., Classical Building Materials (2016) Advanced Research on Nanotechnology for Civil Engineering Applications, IGI Global, pp. 1-27; Sounthararajan, V.

The performance tests for fatigue cracking were undertaken using indirect tensile strength (ITS) tests, indirect tensile fatigue life (ITFL) tests, and indirect tensile resilient modulus (MR) tests. Dynamic creep tests and wheel tracking tests were also performed to assess the rutting behavior of these pavement materials. A heavy metal leaching test was also carried out to ensure that asphalt concrete with the usage of S, as a sustainable aggregate, was safe for the environment. The results indicated that asphalt concretes with S had better Marshall's stability than the asphalt concretes with L, even though they had slightly less ITS values. The ITFL and MR of S asphalt concretes were higher than those of L asphalt concretes, indicating higher fatigue cracking resistance. The MR of S asphalt concretes were found to be higher than the required 3,100 MPa value recommended by AASHTO, while L asphalt concretes did not meet this requirement. In addition, the dynamic creep and wheel tracking test results showed that the S asphalt concretes had superior resistance to permanent deformation as compared to the L asphalt concretes. The usage of medium-sized S aggregate in developing asphalt concrete was evidently more sustainable in terms of engineering and economic perspectives than the usage of large-sized S aggregate. The research results indicated that the sustainable usage of S in asphalt concrete was suitable for the development of heavy traffic volume roads. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Asphalt concrete; Dynamic creep; Indirect tensile fatigue; Pavement geotechnics; Recycled waste; Resilient modulus; Steel slag; Wheel tracking","Aggregates; Asphalt concrete; Concrete aggregates; Cracks; Creep; Fatigue of materials; Heavy metals; Leaching; Lime; Slags; Tensile strength; Wheels; Comparative performance; Economic perspective; Fatigue cracking resistance; Indirect tensile fatigue; Indirect tensile strength; Permanent deformations; Resilient modulus; Superior resistance; Concretes; aggregate; asphalt; concrete; creep; fatigue; leaching; pavement; performance assessment; recycling; resilience; slag; testing method; toxic substance",,,,,"Office of the Higher Education Commission, OHEC; Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC: IC170100006; National Science and Technology Development Agency, สวทช: P-19-52303; Suranaree University of Technology, SUT","This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Development Agency under the Chair Professor program Grant No. P-19-52303, Suranaree University of Technology and the Office of the Higher Education Commission under the NRU Project of Thailand.

The efficient management and recycling of waste products can contribute to environmental sustainability. Trillions of cigarette butts (CBs) are being littered every day around the world, amounting to one-third of the world's littered waste. CBs contain mostly cellulose acetate-based fiber wrapped with paper along with many toxic compounds like burnt tobacco, tar, and heavy metals. Due to their non-biodegradable nature, CBs take years to decompose into the environment and leach out toxic chemicals into the environment in the process. Researchers have investigated different methods to recycle CBs in asphalt concrete and bitumen. Mohajerani et al. in 2017 developed the encapsulation method for cigarette butts and investigated the incorporation of bitumen and wax encapsulated cigarette butts in dense asphalt concrete. Resilient modulus and marshal stability and flow test was carried out on asphalt samples and concluded with promising results. Rahman et al. in 2020 evaluated the use of CBs fiber in bitumen as modifier. As a continuation and expansion of the research, objective of this study was to investigate the rheological performance of CB fiber modified bitumen and the relevance of its application in stone mastic asphalt. The rheological properties like viscosity, complex modulus, and relationship with frequency, temperature, and phase angle were established, and the Linear Amplitude Sweep (LAS) test was performed to assess the fatigue damage resistance criteria of CB fiber modified bitumen. Stone mastic asphalt (SMA) was prepared with CB fiber modified bitumen, and the Marshall Stability and Flow of SMA were investigated and compared with the control sample prepared with conventional virgin cellulose fiber modified bitumen. The results from the test met industry standards and supported the use of CB fiber modified bitumen in the construction of stone mastic asphalt instead of virgin cellulose fiber. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bitumen; Cigarette butts; Fiber; Recycling; Rheology; Stone mastic asphalt","Asphalt concrete; Cellulose; Concretes; Electric circuit breakers; Heavy metals; Recycling; Sustainable development; Textile fibers; Tobacco; Waste management; Cellulose acetates; Efficient managements; Encapsulation methods; Environmental sustainability; Marshall stability; Recycling of wastes; Rheological property; Stone mastic asphalts; Mastic asphalt; Cellulose; Heavy Metals; Recycling; Textile Fibers; Tobacco; Waste Management",,,,,"RMIT University, RMIT","This work is part of an ongoing postgraduate study on recycling cigarette butts in bitumen and asphalt concrete.

In Bulgaria for the period 2013 - 2017, there is an almost threefold decrease in the amount of non-hazardous construction waste generated. During the same period, hazardous construction waste also decreased by over 50%. In 2016, 54% recycling of construction and demolition waste (CDW) was achieved with the aim of achieving a minimum of 70% by 2020 according to the Waste Management Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC [9]). On this basis, amendments to the Waste Management Act (WMA) were introduced and the Ordinance on construction waste management and input of recycled construction materials (NUSOVRM) was prepared. New standards for the quality of construction materials used have been modified and introduced. In order to reduce landfill recycling, financial incentives are provided by municipalities. Some of the public-funded construction sites require a mandatory percentage of recycled waste, depending on the type of site. Specific targets (for construction waste codes) introduced for recovery for each construction - for example 85% for concrete and reinforced concrete waste, 90% for metals. © 2020 Author(s).",,,,,,,"BG05M2OP001-2.009-0011-ɋ01; European Social Fund, ESF","The study was partly supported by contract of Angel Kanchev University of Ruse, no BG05M2OP001-2.009-0011-ɋ01, “Support for the development of human resources for research and innovation at the Angel Kanchev University of Ruse.” The project is funded with support from the Operational Program “Science and Education for Smart Growth 2014 – 2020” financed by the European Social Fund of the European Union.",,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.nsi.bg/node/2541, Bulgarian Statistical Institute; http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2011/305/oj; Hvarchilkova, D., Filipova, M., Zheleva, I., Study on the possibilities to reuse construction and demolition waste in International symposium ""The Environment and the Industry"", SIMI 2019, Proceedings book, doi; Hvarchilkova, D., Legal regulation of construction waste treatment Proc.University of Ruse 2019, 58, pp. 88-94. , in, Vol., Book 1.1, FRI-9.2-1-EC-02, [in Bulgarian]; http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/cdw/cdw_chapter1-6.pdf, Symonds GrouLtd 46967 Final Report February 1999 12; http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics; http://eea.government.bg/bg/legislation/waste/Naredba_8r.pdf; http://www.moew.government.bg/static/media/ups/tiny/file/Waste/cdw/NSPUOSR-final.pdf; http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0098","Zheleva, I.; Ruse University, 8 Studentska str., Bulgaria; email: izheleva@uni-ruse.bg","Todorov M.D.Todorov M.D.","MDPI open access journal Axioms;Ultra Quantum Inc.","American Institute of Physics Inc.","12th International On-line Conference for Promoting the Application of Mathematics in Technical and Natural Sciences, AMiTaNS 2020","24 June 2020 through 29 June 2020",,165423,0094243X,9780735440364,,,"English","AIP Conf.

This by-product can be used as partial replacement for Portland cement, favoring resource conservation and sustainability. Substantial research has explored treated and processed coal bottom ash (CBA) for possible use in the construction industry. The present research explores using local untreated and raw CBA in mitigating the alkali–silica reaction (ASR) of reactive aggregates in concrete. Mortar bar specimens incorporating various proportions of untreated CBA were tested in accordance with ASTM C1260 up to 150 days. Strength activity index (SAI) and thermal analysis were used to assess the pozzolanic activity of CBA. Specimens incorporating 20% CBA achieved SAI greater than 75%, indicating pozzolanic activity. Mixtures incorporating CBA had decreased ASR expansion. Incorporating 20% CBA in mixtures yielded 28-day ASR expansion of less than the ASTM C1260 limit value of 0.20%. Scanning electron microscopy depicted ASR induced microcracks in control specimens, while specimens incorporating CBA exhibited no microcracking. Moreover, low calcium-to-silica ratio and reduced alkali content were observed in specimens incorporating CBA owing to alkali dilution and absorption, consequently decreasing ASR expansion. The toxicity characteristics of CBA indicated the presence of heavy metals below the US-EPA limits. Therefore, using local untreated CBA in concrete as partial replacement for Portland cement can be a non-hazardous alternative for reducing the environmental overburden of cement production and CBA disposal, with the added benefit of mitigating ASR expansion and its associated costly damage, leading to sustainable infrastructure. © 2020 by the authors.

RCA materials have many uses such as a road base or backfilling trenches. Our study investigated the potential water-contamination risks of water exposed to RCA materials. We recirculated water for 60 min through four different treatments. Two treatments were a PVC gutter filled with different size grades of RCA material (20 mm and 45 mm), the third treatment was a clean PVC gutter and the fourth and final treatment was an unused concrete water pipe. Results showed that RCA material exposed to water released a suite of contaminants that could be ecologically hazardous to aquatic species. RCA leached metals over the 60-min recirculation (aluminium, arsenic, barium, chromium, lead, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, lithium and strontium). Water exposed to RCA material exceeded aquatic ecosystem guidelines for aluminium by 50 times and lead by up to 12 times. RCA materials increased pH by up to 4.35 pH units and electrical conductivity (EC) by up to 11 times the starting EC (mean 27.9 µs cm-1). We suggest that RCA materials need to be used with caution in settings that could be exposed to water and flow to waterways of conservation value. © 2021 CSIRO.",,"aggregate; backfill; concrete; electrical conductivity; pipe; recirculating system; recycling; water pollution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Guide to the use of fly-ash in concrete in Australia, , http://www.adaa.asn.au/uploads/default/files/adaa-ref-data-sheet-1.pdf, ADDA (Ash Development Association of Australia) Fly-ash data reference sheet number 1.

Waste CBs take years to decompose with most containing a cellulose-acetate based filter, tar, nicotine, tobacco, and many highly toxic chemicals that leach into the soil and water bodies and cause contamination and toxicity. Mohajerani et al. in 2017 developed the encapsulation method for cigarette butts and investigated the incorporation of bitumen and wax encapsulated cigarette butts in dense asphalt concrete. This research work investigated the possible recycling of bitumen encapsulated CBs in stone mastic asphalt (SMA). Waste CBs were processed and encapsulated with bitumen class PMB A10E. Stone mastic asphalt samples were prepared by replacing coarse aggregates by 1%, 2%, and 3% (by weight) with bitumen encapsulated CBs. Marshall stability, flow, resilient modulus, and volumetric properties of SMA manufactured samples were investigated and the results were compared with those of the control SMA samples prepared without CBs. The experimental procedures and some of the significant outcomes of the study, along with some results from a leachate analysis have been presented and discussed. Average results show that the use of encapsulated CBs in Stone Mastic Asphalt samples manufactured in this study improved the stability and resistance to permanent deformation. Furthermore, the leaching of heavy metals from encapsulated CBs compared with those of unprocessed CBs reduced significantly. Based on the promising results found in this study, further investigations, and development of practical implementation procedures for recycling cigarette butts in asphalt concrete on an industrial scale are recommended. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cigarette butts; Encapsulation; Flexible pavements; Recycling; Stone mastic asphalt; Waste management","Aggregates; Asphalt concrete; Concretes; Electric circuit breakers; Heavy metals; Leaching; Recycling; Smoke; Tobacco; Volumetric analysis; Coarse aggregates; Encapsulation methods; Experimental procedure; Marshall stability; Permanent deformations; Resilient modulus; Stone mastic asphalts; Volumetric properties; Mastic asphalt; Heavy Metals; Leaching; Recycling; Smoke; Tobacco; Volumetry",,,,,"RMIT University, RMIT","This work is part of an ongoing postgraduate study on recycling cigarette butts in asphalt concrete.

These promising approaches will also lead to the protection of natural resources and economic gains. One example of waste disposal maybe by using it as a filling material or as a pozzolanic material for the production of concrete. In this regard, this study proposes to partially replace cement with aluminum dross and fly ash, and partially replace natural sand with quarry dust. Aluminum dross, cement, sand, and quarry dust were used in a variety of proportions with a constant percentage of fly ash for the design of nine concrete mixtures. Aluminum dross was replaced by 5, 10, 15, and 20% of the cement mass. At first, the optimum replacement of aluminum dross without using quarry dust was determined at a constant percentage of fly ash-15% based on the strength results. Later, by introducing the optimum substitution of aluminum dross with cement and fly ash, the quarry dust was partially replaced at 10, 20, 30, and 40% of river sand to determine the overall optimum mix. The mechanical and durability characteristics of the concrete using the three mixtures were analyzed. It has been observed that the mechanical and durability characteristics of a concrete mixture incorporating a fly ash-15%, aluminum dross-10%, and quarry dust-20% are better than that of standard concrete. Production of concrete using industrial waste can minimize infrastructure construction costs and reduce environmental impacts. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, different amounts of CKD (0–40%), as a waste material, and FA (0–30%) as a pozzolanic material, were used as a single and hybrid replacement of cement. Then, Taguchi method with two parameters of water to binder ratios and cement replacement ratio was used to determine the optimal mixing designs before construction from environmental and economic points of view. Comparison of the Taguchi method and experimental results for selecting the most favorable mixture designs showed that Taguchi method exhibited suitable choices in the range of optimal experimental results with regard to the initial parameters. This means that if the water-to-cement, CKD-to-cement, and the fly ash-to-cement ratios were 0.45, 9%, and 14%, respectively, it would be possible to obtain the best possible values for the strength to price, CO2 emission factor, and the standard deviation ratio. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cement kiln dust; Green concrete; Hazardous material; Optimal mixing design; Recycling; Taguchi method","Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Concrete industry; Construction industry; Dust; Fly ash; Kilns; Taguchi methods; Cement replacement; Effect of carbons; Fresh and hardened properties; Initial parameter; Optimal solutions; Pozzolanic materials; Standard deviation; Water-to-binder ratio; Concretes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Marcia, K., US Geological Survey: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011 (2011), USGS USA; Tahmouresi, B., Koushkbaghi, M., Monazami, M., Abbasi, M.T., Nemati, P., Experimental and statistical analysis of hybrid-fiber-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (2019) Comput.

Utilizing waste CRT glass to substitute river sand to fabricate eco-friendly ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is an appealing recycling and resource conservation option. The superior mechanical properties of eco-friendly UHPC at static loads suggest its potential application in key infrastructures. However, key infrastructures have a high risk of exposing to extreme loads, and the dynamic performance of eco-friendly UHPC under high strain rates is insufficient to withstand extreme loads, impeding its wide application. In this study, the environmental and economic implications of eco-friendly UHPC were evaluated by life cycle assessment and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. The feasibility of using silane coupling agent (SCA) modified steel fibers to enhance dynamic performance of eco-friendly UHPC was investigated. Results show that recycling waste CRT glass through eco-friendly UHPC significantly reduces the energy consumption, CO2 emissions, human toxicity potential and disposal cost. SCA modified steel fibers are effective in improving peak toughness and energy absorption capacity of eco-friendly UHPC, implying better resistance to dynamic loads. The behind mechanism is the steel fiber-matrix interfacial bond is enhanced by SCA, thus absorbing more energy and delaying interfacial debonding. SCA modification approach can improve the recovery efficiency of waste CRT glass and promote the environmental performance of UHPC. The findings contribute to direct recycling of waste CRT glass and conservation of natural resource with enormous environmental and economic benefits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cathode ray tube; Dynamic performance; Life cycle assessment; Recycling; Silane coupling agent; Ultra-high performance concrete","Cathode ray tubes; Cathode rays; Cathodes; Conservation; Coupling agents; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Electronic Waste; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Glass; Life cycle; Natural resources management; Obsolescence; Recycling; Steel fibers; Strain rate; Toxicity; Waste disposal; Energy absorption capacity; Environmental concerns; Environmental performance; Human toxicity potentials; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Silane coupling agent; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedures; Ultra high performance concretes (UHPC); Ultra-high performance concrete; concrete; cost analysis; hazardous waste; recycling; reinforced concrete; toxicity; waste disposal; waste technology; Article; carbon footprint; compressive strength; energy consumption; environmental economics; environmental factor; environmental indicator; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; feasibility study; flow rate; leaching; life cycle assessment; performance; recycling; river sand; sand; stress strain relationship; toxicity testing; waste disposal",,,,,"2019A1515012002; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51678200, 51878225, 51908167; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFC0705400","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China ( 2018YFC0705400 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51878225 , 51678200 , 51908167 ); and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2019A1515012002 ).",,,,,,,,,,,,"Al Razi, K.M.H., Resourceful recycling process of waste desktop computers: a review study (2016) Resour.

When crushed, flat panel display glass has similar physical properties to sand and could be used as a recycled aggregate in concrete, if the potentially harmful metals in FPDG can be encapsulated. To replicate leaching from environmental exposure, at periodic points during freeze–thaw tests, samples of concrete with 0%, 10%, and 20% FPDG were exposed to simulated rainwater and the runoff water was analyzed. For the metals detected (arsenic, barium, chromium, and lead), lead concentrations in the leachate/runoff from 20% FPDG samples exceeded the acute ambient water quality criteria after approximately 50–60 cycles; however, no samples exceeded the toxic characteristic leaching procedure limits at any point during freeze–thaw testing. Increases in lead and chromium concentrations over time indicate a need for stabilization, especially since lead exceeded the acute water quality criteria. Practitioner points: TCLP results indicate flat panel display glass is not expected to release RCRA-8 metals at or above regulatory limits. Accelerated aging–leaching tests indicate lead might be released at levels approaching or exceeding the acute ambient water quality criteria. With additional lead stabilization, this study shows flat panel display glass has the potential to be used in concrete. © 2020 Water Environment Federation","concrete; display glass; electronic waste; water quality","Chromium; Concrete aggregates; Concrete slabs; Concrete testing; Glass; Heavy metals; Leaching; Plasma display devices; Runoff; Stabilization; Thawing; Water quality; Water recycling; Chromium concentration; Environmental exposure; Flat panel display glass; Heavy metal composition; Lead stabilization; Recycled aggregates; Toxic characteristic leaching procedures; Water quality criteria; Flat panel displays; arsenic; barium; chromium; concrete; glass; lead; heavy metal; aggregate; chromium; concentration (composition); concrete; freeze-thaw cycle; leaching; runoff; water quality; Article; environmental exposure; freeze thawing; leaching; nonhuman; priority journal; runoff; water quality; recycling; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Recycling; Water Quality",,"arsenic, 7440-38-2; barium, 7440-39-3; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; Lead; Metals, Heavy",,,"Penn State Harrisburg, Pennsylvania State University","This project was funded by the Pennsylvania Recycling Marketing Center, Inc. and Penn State Harrisburg.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Akhras, N.M., Performance of glass concrete subjected to freeze-thaw cycling (2012) The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, 6, pp. 392-397. , https://doi.org/10.2174/1874836801206010392; Bernot, M.J., Calkins, M., Bernot, R.J., Hunt, M., The influence of different urban pavements on water chemistry (2011) Road Materials and Pavement Design, 12 (1), pp. 159-176. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14680629.2011.9690357; Brown, G., (2019) Global sand shortage could cause damaging effects to our urban world, , https://www.businessinsider.com/global-sand-shortage-could-cause-damaging-effects-2018-12, Bus.

Recycled plastic bricks have the potential to divert valuable post-consumer plastic waste from landfills, locking up this plastic for decades to come. A comparison of the material properties, as well as the greater societal impacts, of virgin PET and concrete comprise this study. The compressive strengths of the two materials are compared using both published data and a computational analysis.

Proper management of C&DW and recycled materials—including the correct handling of hazardous waste—can have major benefits in terms of sustainability and the quality of life. The Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC aims to have 70% of C&DW recycled by 2020. However, except for a few EU countries, only about 50% of C&DW is currently being recycled. In the present research, the environmental impact of concrete with recycled aggregates and with geopolymer mixtures is analysed. The aim of the present research is to propose a comparative LCA of concrete with recycled aggregates in the context of European politics. Methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is applied using Simapro© software. A cradle to grave analysis is carried out. The results are analysed based on the database Ecoinvent 3.3 and Impact 2002+. Results: Results show that the concrete with 25% recycled aggregates is the best solution from an environmental point of view. Furthermore, geopolymer mixtures could be a valid alternative to reduce the phenomenon of “global warming”; however, the production of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide has a great environmental impact. Conclusions: A possible future implementation of the present study is certainly to carry out an overall assessment and to determine the most cost-effective option among the different competing alternatives through the life cycle cost analysis. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","C&DW;

Sewage sludge from the wastewater treatment plant at Koprivnica in Croatia has been treated using MID-MIX® technology that involves the addition of Ca(OH)2 and CaO to dewatered sludge. This produces a low-density non-hazardous white-grey powder. The treated sewage sludge has been heated to 800, 900 and 1000 °C to form MID-MIX® treated sewage sludge ash with reduced organic content. MID-MIX® treated sewage sludge and ash have been used to replace 10 and 20% of cement in mortar and concrete samples. The addition of MID-MIX® treated sewage sludge causes a significant increase in void content which reduces the mechanical properties and durability of mortar and concrete samples. However, replacement of cement by MID-MIX® ash did not significantly affect the strength, water penetration or gas permeability compared to control samples. Leaching tests on MID-MIX® powder, MID-MIX® ash and mortar samples produced low levels of heavy metal release. The research shows that thermally processed MID-MIX® treated sewage sludge produces an ash product that has potential to be beneficially used in cementitious materials for selected applications. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cement; concrete; mortar; Sewage sludge; thermal treatment","Cements; Durability; Gas permeability; Heat treatment; Heavy metals; Hydrated lime; Mortar; Powder metals; Sewage sludge; Sludge disposal; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Cementitious materials; Concrete samples; Dewatered sludge; Heavy metal release; Recycling options; Sewage sludge ash; Wastewater treatment plants; Water penetration; Concretes",,,,,"Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ: 7927","This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation [project number 7927] - Reuse of sewage sludge in concrete industry: from microstructure to innovative construction products.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Standard test method for density of hydraulic cement, , 2017). ; Brkljac, N., Sevic, D., Beker, I., Kesic, I., Milisavljevic, S., Procedure for treatment of hazardous waste by MID-MIX procedure in Serbia (2012) International Journal of Physical Sciences, 7, pp. 2639-2646; Chen, L., Lin, D.F., Applications of sewage sludge ash and nano-SiO2 to manufacture tile as construction material (2009) Construction and Building Materials, 23, pp. 3312-3320; Chen, M., Blanc, D., Gautier, M., Mehu, J., Gourdon, R., Environmental and technical assessments of the potential utilization of sewage sludge ashes (SSAs) as secondary raw materials in construction (2013) Waste Management, 33, pp. 1268-1275; Cyr, M., Coutand, M., Clastres, P., Technological and environmental behaviour of sewage sludge ash (SSA) in cement-based materials (2007) Cement and Concrete Research, 37, pp. 1278-1289; Garcés, P., Pérez Carriόn, M., García-Alcocel, E., Payá, J., Monzό, J., Borrachero, M.V., Mechanical and physical properties of cement blended with sewage sludge ash (2008) Waste Management, 28, pp. 2495-2502; Geiker, M., Grube, H., Luping, T., Nilsson, L.O., Andrade, C., (1995) Laboratory test methods, pp. 144-147. , Rilem Report 12; (2008) Methods of test for mortar for masonry–Part 3: Determination of consistence of fresh mortar (by flow table); (2008) Methods of test for mortar for masonry–Part 2: Bulk sampling of mortars and preparation of test mortars; (2000) Methods of test for mortar for masonry.

This has resulted in the accumulation of large stocks of toxic rubber waste that raise health and safety risks. The use of waste tire rubber for the construction of the concrete structure was suggested to combat this challenge. This paper explores tests that were performed with samples of waste tire rubber concrete to evaluate compressive strength, flexural tensile strength, modulus of rupture, and impacts resistance. The main parameters investigated were the rubber ratio as a partial volumetric replacement with fine and coarse aggregate. Chip and crumb rubbers were used to replace coarse and fine aggregate respectively in four different amounts by volume (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%). Even if the inclusion of waste tire rubber in concrete has specific apparent degradations, the potential benefit seems to overlook the adverse effects and also meet the primary significant value of resolution for rubber waste utilization problems. The results show that the substitution of natural fine or coarse aggregates with crump-chip tier rubber will reduce mechanical properties (compressive, flexural and splitting tensile strength), but increase the impacts resistance to 426% and 396% when 20% coarse aggregates and 20% fine aggregates are replaced by rubber respectively. The proposed mix shows an ability to replace 20% of the aggregate (coarse or fine), and the producing, rubcrete, still structural concrete. © 2020 by the authors.","Drop weight impact test; Impact resistance; Rubber aggregates; Rubberized concrete; Waste tire rubber",,,,,,"Baylor University","The author would like to extend many thanks and gratitude to the staff of the Civil Engineering Department at Babylon University for their dedicated work and continuous giving in helping researchers and providing all possible facilities to accomplish this research.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Youssf, Osama, ElGawady, Mohamed A., Mills, Julie E., Experimental Investigation of Crumb Rubber Concrete Columns Under Seismic Loading (2015) Structures, 3, pp. 13-27. , (August); Eldin, Neil N., Senouci, Ahmed B., Rubber-Tire Particles as Concrete Aggregate (1993) Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 5 (4), pp. 478-496. , (November)); Ganjian, Eshmaiel, Khorami, Morteza, Maghsoudi, Ali Akbar, Scrap-Tyre-Rubber Replacement for Aggregate and Filler in Concrete (2009) Construction and Building Materials, 23 (5), pp. 1828-1836. , (May); Antil, Yogender, Verma, Er Vivek, Singh, Er Bhupinder, Rubberized concrete made with crumb rubber (2014) International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 3 (5), pp. 1481-1483; Bhatt, Bhavik, Khandla, Parth, Kauswala, Tausif, Experimental Study of Crumb Rubber in Concrete (2017) GRD Journals-Global Research and Development Journal for Engineering, 2 (6), pp. 151-155; Gerges, Najib N., Issa, Camille A., Fawaz, Samer A., Rubber Concrete: Mechanical and Dynamical Properties (2018) Case Studies in Construction Materials, 9, p. e00184. , (December); Topçu, I.B., Physical and Mechanical Properties of Concretes Produced with Waste Concrete (1997) Cement and Concrete Research, 27 (12), pp. 1817-1823. , (December); Hernández-Olivares, F., Barluenga, G., Bollati, M., Witoszek, B., Static and Dynamic Behaviour of Recycled Tyre Rubber-Filled Concrete (2002) Cement and Concrete Research, 32 (10), pp. 1587-1596. , (October); Li, Lijuan, Ruan, Shenghua, Zeng, Lan, Mechanical Properties and Constitutive Equations of Concrete Containing a Low Volume of Tire Rubber Particles (2014) Construction and Building Materials, 70, pp. 291-308. , (November); Aiello, M.A., Leuzzi, F., Waste Tyre Rubberized Concrete: Properties at Fresh and Hardened State (2010) Waste Management, 30 (8-9), pp. 1696-1704. , (August); Fattuhi, N.I., Clark, L.A., Cement-Based Materials Containing Shredded Scrap Truck Tyre Rubber (1996) Construction and Building Materials, 10 (4), pp. 229-236. , (June); (1984), Iraqi Specificatio 5 1984, Portland cement; (1984) Aggregate from natural sources for concrete and building construction, , Iraqi Specificatio 45-1984; (1989) Method for determination of compressive strength of concrete cube, , BS 1881 part 116, British Standards Institutions; (2009) ASTM Standard C496/ C496M: Standard Test Method for Splitting Tensile Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens, , ASTM International, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, USA; Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of Concrete (Using Simple Beam with Third-Point Loading (2002) Annual Book of ASTM Standards, , ASTM C78-02, American Society for Testing and Materials; (2010) State-of-the-Art Report on Fiber Reinforced Concrete, , ACI Committee 544, 544.1R-10, American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, MI, USA; Al-Mutairee, H.M, Al-Hamdani, HA., Shear Behaviours of Hybrid Continuous Deep Beams Strengthened with Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 433, p. 012027. , (November 30); Al-Mutairee, Hayder MK, Al-Hamdani, Hussein Ali, Flexure Behavior of Hybrid Continuous Deep Beam Strengthened by Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (2017) Journal of University of Babylon, 25 (5), pp. 1580-1592; Al-Sultany, Saja A.S., Al-Mutairee, Hayder M.K., Shear Span-Depth Ratio on The Behavior of Hybrid Reinforced Concrete Continuous Straight Deep Beam (2018) International Journal of Civil Engineering and Technology, (IJCIET), 9 (12), pp. 985-992","Kadhim, A.A.; College of Engineering, Iraq; email: ali.abdulameer.kadhim@gmail.com",,,"Salehan Institute of Higher Education",,,,,26766957,,,,"English","Civ. eng. j.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099666740

Accordingly, this work aims at eco-sustainable recycling concrete waste (CoW) and hazardous lead-bearing sludge (LBS) in the cleaner production of alkali-activated cementitious materials. The activation of powdered-CoW with different sodium hydroxide (NaOH) contents yields hardened materials, with modest compressive strengths, in which pirssonite is the dominant binding phase as confirmed by X-ray diffractogram, thermal analyses, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. These materials demonstrate low stability in humidity-rich-environment as a significant regression in their mechanical properties was recorded after 30-days of curing. The use of sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) as alternative to NaOH represents two synergistic positive effects, which are working together, including the enhancement of mechanical properties and stability of the hardened materials at the long term of curing. The positive impact of Na2SiO3 is mainly originated from the formation silicate-rich strength-giving-phases with higher binding capacity and stability compared to pirssonite-phase. LBS was beneficially used as an alternative silicate source to avoid the negative impact of Na2SiO3 on environment. The incorporation of 10 wt % LBS in NaOH–CoW system has resulted in the creation of hardened material with mechanical properties superior to Na2SiO3–CoW one, notably long run stability. The high Pb-immobilization, stability, and acceptable compressive strength are the dominant parameters which directly reflect on the safe and benefit use of NaOH–CoW/LBS10 composite as building brick. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali-activation; Building bricks; Concrete waste; Lead-bearing sludge; Pb-leaching; Recycling","Bearings (machine parts); Brick; Chemical activation; Compressive strength; Construction industry; Curing; Hardening; Historic preservation; Infrared spectroscopy; Pollution control; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicates; Silicon; Sodium hydroxide; Stability; Thermoanalysis; Alkali activation; Alkali-activated concretes; Cementitious materials; Cleaner production; Concrete wastes; Construction sectors; Naturally occurring; X-ray diffractograms; Concretes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdel Gawwad, H.A., Khater, H.M., Abd El-Aleem, S., Coupled effect of alkali concentration and metakaolin content on accelerated ageing of slag (2016) Geosyst.

Furthermore, aside from the expensive costs required, processed varieties are also highly limited. This study examines a simple method with good potentials to be developed by the government as well as the community and the result of this study is expected to be one of the solutions in overcoming the waste problem. Besides, based on data obtained from the Kebon Kongok Regional Landfill, West Lombok, the average composition of the community waste was almost 73.5% plastic, 24.6% organic materials and 1.9% B3 (dangerous and toxic material) waste. The method developed was very simple, as it involved heating a cleaned plastic mixture about 168°C in a closed system, and subsequently, the gas and smoke produced were liquefied and cooled. Heating is carried out in a reactor made of stainless still with a total volume of about 20 liters equipped with temperature control. Meanwhile, the remaining combustion that was in the molten phase was therefore molded into building materials, e.g., paving blocks, with compressive strength that is comparable to ordinary concrete. In addition, the results of liquid smoke condensation, further, produced two light fractions that were not mixed. GCMS analysis showed that the hydrocarbon compound has the number of carbons in range 8-12 atom for both fractions. Based on the FT-IR and UV-Vis spectrums confirmed the presence of aromatic benzene groups in both the fraction, while the second fraction contains more complex hydrocarbon than the first fraction. Major hydrocarbon in the first fraction is n-nonene and 5-methyl-1-heptene, whereas major hydrocarbon in the second fraction is n-nonene, 5-methyl-1-heptene and n-decene. © 2020 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jambeck, J.R., Geyer, R., Wilcox, C., Siegler, T.R., Perryman, M., Andrady, A., Narayan, R., Law, K.L., (2015) Science, 347 (6223), pp. 768-771; Arnani, M., (2018) PT.

The scrap is mostly originated from end-of-life vehicles (ELV).Therefore, this residue is known as automotive shredder residue (ASR). Throughout the world, is estimated that more than 25 million vehicles turn into an ELV every year, and most of their resources end up in landfill. Occasionally, hazardous substances may appear on the Shredder waste, which are very heterogeneous as a result of the variety of material fed into the equipment. Thus, Shredder waste has become a worldwide problem due to its environmental impact, heterogeneous composition and its recycling has been a challenge. Therefore, this manuscript addresses the characterization of the fine fraction of ASR generated in a plant located in Brazil. It is also proposed its recycling in concrete paving blocks to replace the natural fine aggregate through the Portland cement solidification/stabilization (S/S) technique. S/S prevents the release of hazardous chemicals from waste. As a result, with a 20% substitution content of the fine sand for the waste, 6 out 8 toxic elements presented in the residue were encapsulated by cement (total phenol, total iron, fluorettes, manganese, selenium, surfactants) and reached the required by the Brazilian standard. The two non-encapsulated elements were aluminum, whose concentration showed a 62.5% decrease, and cadmium, which is also found in conventional blocks. The concrete paving blocks showed good mechanical and physical performance.

An innovative approach is demonstrated in this study to transform contaminated sediment into eco-friendly foamed concrete by adding cement, foam and silica fume without heating and pressure. With the foam percent rising from 0% to 80% (v/v), the compressive strength and dry density of foamed concrete decreased from 18.8 to 2.1 MPa and from 1442 to 620.6 kg m−3, respectively. Accordingly, the thermal conductivity declined from 0.516 to 0.173 W m−1·K−1, and water resistance coefficient decreased from 0.73 to 0.43. Dosage of 10% silica fume as substitution of part of cement exhibited a comprehensive optimization of the concrete properties because of its activity in the hydration reaction and pore-filling effect identified by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) attached with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It also narrowed the pore size distribution and made the pore structure more uniform and denser detected by optical microscope. Heavy metals in the sediment can be immobilized by 81.5–98.1% for As, Cr, Cu and Zn, even in an acidic environment. This study provides new opportunities for hazardous dredged river sediment recycling, which is prospective because it not only consumes a large amount of sediment but also avoids depletion of resources and creates profits. © 2019","Dredged river sediment; Economic analysis; Foamed concrete; Heavy metal leaching; Mechanical properties; Silica fume","Cements; Compressive strength; Concretes; Dredging; Economic analysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Environmental protection; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Heavy metals; Mechanical properties; Polypropylenes; Pore size; Pore structure; Rivers; Scanning electron microscopy; Sediments; Silica fume; Soil pollution; Comprehensive optimizations; Contaminated river sediments; Contaminated sediment; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Foamed concrete; Innovative approaches; Metal leaching; River sediments; River pollution",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 21577087, 41877110; China National Critical Project for Science and Technology on Water Pollution Prevention and Control: 2017ZX07202005-005, 2017ZX07204002-03","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China  (No.  21577087 ,  41877110 ) and the National Water Pollution Control Key Project (No. 2017ZX07202005-005 , 2017ZX07204002-03 ) .

These products are filling landfills and reducing the amount of livable space. Leachate produced from landfills contaminates the surrounding environment. The conventional incineration process releases toxic airborne fumes into the atmosphere. Researchers are working continuously to explore sustainable ways to manage and recycle waste materials. Recycling and reuse are the most efficient methods in waste management. The pavement industry is one promising sector, as different sorts of waste are being recycled into asphalt concrete and bitumen. This paper provides an overview of some promising waste products like high-density polyethylene, marble quarry waste, building demolition waste, ground tire rubber, cooking oil, palm oil fuel ash, coconut, sisal, cellulose and polyester fiber, starch, plastic bottles, waste glass, waste brick, waste ceramic, waste fly ash, and cigarette butts, and their use in asphalt concrete and bitumen. Many experts have investigated these waste materials and tried to find ways to use this waste for asphalt concrete and bitumen. In this paper, the outcomes from some significant research have been analyzed, and the scope for further investigation is discussed. © 2020 by the authors.","Advanced materials; Asphalt concrete; Environmental sustainability; Recycling; Waste materials","Asphalt concrete; Concretes; Demolition; Fly ash; Glass bottles; Leachate treatment; Palm oil; Plastic bottles; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Polyesters; Recycling; Rubber products; Sustainable development; Wastes; Advanced materials; Building demolition; Environmental sustainability; Ground tire rubbers; Incineration process; Pavement industry; Recycling of wastes; Surrounding environment; Waste incineration; Asphalt; Bitumen; Concrete; Fly Ash; Plastic Containers; Polyesters; Recycling; Wastes",,,,,"RMIT University, RMIT","Acknowledgments: This work is part of an ongoing postgraduate study on recycling cigarette butts in asphalt concrete.

Waste tyres in landfill and stockpiles are renowned for leaching toxic chemicals into the surrounding environment, acting as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and fuelling inextinguishable fires. The properties of waste tyre rubber and engineering applications have been previously reported in a range of publications with respect to the environmental, economic, and technical factors. This study compiles and reviews this research with a focus on geotechnical engineering applications, such as earthworks and infrastructure construction. The applications of waste rubber in construction materials includes cementitious concrete, asphalt concrete, and granular materials for earth structures. Crumb rubber, when used as a sand replacement in flowable concrete fill, improved ductility and strength-to-weight ratio. A 40 MPa concrete mix with 0.6% rubber crumb content exhibited optimal strength and air entrainment capabilities, displaying minimal damage after 56 freeze/thaw cycles. Rubber, as a partial replacement for aggregate in road base and sub-base layers, adversely affected the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the graded aggregate base course. Rubber-soil mixtures as the interface of foundation and structure yielded a 60–70 % reduction in vertical and horizontal ground accelerations when subjected to earthquake simulation modelling. There is concern regarding the toxicity of waste rubber incorporated products due to leachates of heavy metals and other chemicals common in tyres. Further comprehensive studies in this area are needed. Leachate studies should be conducted under different pH and liquid to solid ratios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Construction materials; Environmental sustainability; Leachate; Recycling; Rubber tyres; Waste rubber","Aggregates; Air entrainment; Building materials; Concrete mixtures; Earthquake engineering; Geotechnical engineering; Heavy metals; Leachate treatment; Recycling; Rubber industry; Strength of materials; Sustainable development; Tire industry; Tires; Wheels; California bearing ratio; Engineering applications; Environmental considerations; Environmental sustainability; Infrastructure construction; Leachates; Strength to weight ratio; Waste rubber; Rubber applications; concrete; crumb rubber; heavy metal; rubber; unclassified drug; construction material; geotechnical engineering; leachate; recycling; rubber; sustainability; tire; toxicity; waste; California bearing ratio; chemical parameters; compressive strength; earthquake; elasticity; environmental factor; environmental impact; hydraulic conductivity; leaching; pH measurement; physical chemistry; recycling; Review; rubber industry; shear strength; simulation; soil property; water absorption; water absorption capacity",,"rubber, 9006-04-6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdul Hassan, N., Airey, G.D., MdYusoff, N.I., Hainin, M.R., Putrajaya, R., Abdullah, M.E., Aziz, A., M.

Bottom ash is the by-products of municipal solid waste incineration with limited recycling options due to harmful contaminants. To decrease the environmental risk of bottom ash and provide an economical and green route to reuse it, a wet chemistry method is applied to prepare hydrophobic bottom ash and investigate its potential to improve transport properties of concrete. The functionalization of fine bottom ash (<0.125 μm) using stearic acid provides hydrophobic nature to the particles along with improved leaching properties. At an optimum addition of 4% stearic acid, the bottom ash present a water contact angle of 141° and can be classified as hydrophobic. The influence of functionalized bottom ash on the cement hydration, mechanical properties, water absorption and wetting property of the water resisting mortar is investigated. Results show that the up to 30% of the binder can be replaced by hydrophobic bottom ash as it decreases the capillary water absorption rate and chloride penetration depth by 57% and 65%, respectively. The samples containing hydrophobic bottom ash show better mechanical properties as compared to the samples made with untreated bottom ash. The environmental assessment shows that the mortars containing functionalized BA are environmentally friendly because of the dilution effect and immobilization potential of the hazardous material into the cementitious matrix. Results show that the proposed method is a facile and efficient way to change bottom ash into hydrophobic powders, which leads to more environmentally friendly water-resisting mortar. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom ash; Hydrophobic; Mortar; Stearic acid","Ash handling; Ashes; Chlorine compounds; Contact angle; Hydration; Hydrophobicity; Mechanical properties; Mortar; Municipal solid waste; Stearic acid; Water absorption; Bottom ash; Capillary water absorption; Cementitious matrices; Chloride penetration; Environmental assessment; Hydrophobic; Properties of concretes; Waste incineration ash; Waste incineration",,,,,"51461135005; 10019729","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by NWO foundation (Project number 10019729: “Environmental concrete based on the treated MSWI bottom ashes”) and the EPSRC-NSFC Joint Research Project (No. 51461135005 ) for funding this research.

In this paper, an innovative cementitious material, ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) was introduced to recycle hazardous waste CRT without lead extraction. Crushed CRT funnel glass without lead extraction was used to replace sand as fine aggregate in various ratios in UHPC. The mechanical properties and toxic heavy metal leachability of UHPC were investigated. Results showed that the addition of CRT glass can increase the flowability and decrease the compressive and flexural strength of UHPC. Analyses by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the CRT glass increases the porosity, inhibits cement hydration, and weakens the interfacial transition zone, resulting in the reduced strength of UHPC. Meanwhile, the leached lead concentration of UHPC was still below regulatory limit of U.S. code even when the replacement ratio reaches 100%. The working principle behind the sharp drop in leached lead in UHPC was proposed, that is the dense microstructure and low permeability coefficient of UHPC can effectively restrain the lead leaching from CRT glass. The findings of this study can provide an effective alternative to recycling hazardous waste CRT without limitations on the replacement ratio and safety concern. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cathode ray tube; Lead leaching; Mechanical properties; Sustainability; Ultra-high performance concrete; Waste recycling","Cathode ray tubes; Cathode rays; Cathodes; Compressive strength; Electronic Waste; Extraction; Glass; Glass transition; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Heavy metals; Hydration; Leaching; Mechanical properties; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Sustainable development; Cementitious materials; Compressive and flexural strengths; Interfacial transition zone; Lead concentration; Lead leaching; Toxic heavy metals; Ultra high performance concretes; Waste recycling; High performance concrete",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51678200, 51878225; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFC0705400; Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality: JCYJ20170811160514862","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China ( 2018YFC0705400 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51878225 , 51678200 ); and Program of Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan ( JCYJ20170811160514862 ).","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0705400); National Natural Science Foundation of China (51878225, 51678200); and Program of Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan (JCYJ20170811160514862).",,,,,,,,,,,"Andreola, F., Barbieri, L., Corradi, A., Lancellotti, I., CRT glass state of the art - a case study: recycling in ceramic glazes (2007) J.

In this study, the effect of cementitious materials i.e. viscosity modifier, silica fume and fly ash on the 226Ra, 232Th and 40K activity levels of barite concrete shields was researched by using different mixing compositions in terms of binder content, w/b ratio and the amount of supplementary cementitious materials. In comparison to cement, silica fume and fly ash used in the production of concrete shields were found to have significantly higher activity levels of 40K, as well as 226Ra, 232Th and 40K, respectively. The 226Ra, 232Th and 40K activity levels of concrete shields range between 2.2 and 20.7 Bq kg−1; 2.6 and 7.0 Bq kg−1; 51.5 and 89.3 Bq kg−1, respectively. These activity values were found similar or less than those of building materials in the world. These satisfactory results are mostly caused by the barite source which has lower radioactivity levels. The concrete mixture details used in the study caused significant variation in the natural radioactivity of barite concrete shields. The introduction of silica fume which has high 40K activity levels and fly ash with high 226Ra, 232Th and 40K activity levels compared to cement and barite aggregate, significantly increased the radiological hazard parameters, although all results were found to be below the limits recommended by international reports. In conclusion, 226Ra activity levels of the concrete shields were significantly increased (up to 8.4 times) by the variation of mix design parameters used in comparison with concrete mixtures that have the least 226Ra activity level. The 232Th and 40K activity levels were as well increased in relatively less amounts (1.7 and 0.73 times higher, respectively). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barite concrete shields; Fly ash; Natural radioactivity; Recycling radioactive by-products; Silica fume; Viscosity modifier","Barite; Cements; Concrete mixing; Concrete products; Fly ash; Hazards; Mixtures; Radiation; Radioactivity; Radiometry; Recycling; Silica fume; Viscosity; Activity levels; Cementitious materials; Natural radioactivity; Radioactivity level; Radiological hazard; Radionuclide concentration; Supplementary cementitious material; Viscosity modifiers; Concrete mixtures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shirmardi, S.P., Shamsaei, M., Naserpour, M., Comparison of photon attenuation coefficients of various barite concrete and lead by MCNP code, XCOM and experimental data (2013) Ann.

There are many indications that this view is no longer valid and that the limiting of natural aggregates usage is doubly justified. Firstly, the extraction of natural aggregates is expensive and has a huge impact on the environment. The main issues in sand and gravel mining are the large areas that are affected, ground water level changes, illegal mining, unsuitability of desert and marine sand, and costs of transport. Secondly, metallurgical waste can be used as a substitute for natural aggregates. This is doubly beneficial-the waste is recycled and the use of natural aggregates is reduced. Waste is stored in landfills that take up large areas and there is also the possibility of ground and groundwater pollution by hazardous compounds. The research presented in this article focuses on the technological conditions of using metallurgical waste in its original form and as a component of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The use of metallurgical sludge waste or crushed or round RCA to produce concrete deteriorates the consistency and does not significantly affect the air content and density of the concrete mix. RCA lowers the density of hardened concrete. Metallurgical sludge waste or RCA usage adversely affect the absorbability and permeability of concrete. Concrete containing metallurgical sludge waste is of higher compressive strength after 7 and 28 days, with up to 60% of waste as a sand replacement. RCA concrete achieved higher compressive strength also. © 2020 by the authors.","Aggregate; Circular economy; Concrete; Concrete properties; Metallurgical sludge waste; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled concrete aggregate","Aggregates; Compressive strength; Concrete mixtures; Concretes; Electric arcs; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hazardous materials; Metallurgy; Metals; Mining laws and regulations; Recycling; Sand; Water levels; Circular economy; Concrete properties; Metallurgical sludge; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled concrete aggregates; Concrete aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aggregates Market Size, Share Industry Research Report https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/aggregates-market/methodology, Available online: (accessed on 5 February 2020); Peduzzi, P., Sand, Rarer than one Thinks (2014) Environ.

Although trivial in size, trillions of cigarettes are produced every year worldwide, resulting in the accumulation of tonnes of toxic waste litter. In 2016, a world production of over 5.7 trillion cigarettes was reported with the majority comprising cellulose acetate filters – a polymer with poor biodegradability. Depending on the environmental conditions, cellulose acetate filters can take up to 10 years to decompose during which time they leach heavy metals and toxic chemicals into the environment. Although possible disposal methods for collected cigarette butt waste include incineration and landfilling, both techniques may result in the release of hazardous fumes and can be costly. However, recycling CBs in different materials could be a possible solution for this concurrent environmental pollution. A number of novel studies have been publicized on recycling cigarette butts with encouraging results, and several methods have been studied, including recycling of cigarette butts in asphalt concrete and fired clay bricks, as a carbon source, sound absorbing material, corrosion inhibitor, biofilm carrier, and many more. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review and discussion of various studies that have been carried out on the toxicity and valorization of cigarette butt waste and investigates the feasibility and sustainability of recycling methods adopted. Further research and developments are essential for the widespread application of recycling cigarette butts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cellulose acetate; Cigarette butts; Environmental management; Recycling; Waste materials","Acoustic wave absorption; Biodegradability; Biodegradable polymers; Cellulose; Corrosion; Environmental management; Health risks; Heavy metals; Recycling; Sustainable development; Tobacco; Toxicity; Waste disposal; Wastes; Cellulose acetates; Cigarette butts; Environmental conditions; Environmental pollutions; Fired clay bricks; Freshwater organisms; Research and development; Sound absorbing materials; Waste incineration; activated carbon; asphalt concrete; biofilm carrier; carbon; caryophyllene; caryophyllene oxide; cellulose acetate; charred carbon; concrete; environmental chemical; nanocrystal; porous carbon; superhydrophobic sorbent; unclassified drug; acetate; environmental management; recycling; solid waste; toxicity; valorization; waste disposal; acidification; chemical composition; chemical oxygen demand; chemical parameters; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); corrosion inhibition efficiency; environmental management; environmental sustainability; feasibility study; genotoxicity; leaching; mutagenicity; ozonation; priority journal; recycling; Review; tobacco; toxicity; valorization; vector control; volatilization; waste management; Biodegradability; Cellulose; Corrosion; Heavy Metals; Recycling; Tobacco",,"activated carbon, 64365-11-3, 82228-96-4; carbon, 7440-44-0; caryophyllene, 87-44-5; caryophyllene oxide, 1139-30-6; cellulose acetate, 9004-35-7",,,"RMIT University, RMIT","This work is part of an ongoing postgraduate study on recycling cigarette butts in fired-clay bricks.

Campi 103, Modena, 41125, Italy","The directives of the European Commission Environment on the management of hazardous asbestos-containing materials (ACM) are pointing towards treatment and recycling other than disposal in landfills. KRY·AS is a secondary raw material obtained by the thermal transformation of cement-asbestos (CA) and can be inserted in the production line of e.g. concrete, clay bricks, ceramics, and plastic materials. This being a possible future solution to the huge “CA-emergency” in Italy, additional recycling options are sought. In this work, KRY·AS was used for the production of glass-ceramic frits destined for the manufacturing of porcelain stoneware slabs. Two novel frits were obtained by vitrifying KRY·AS together with minor amounts of natural raw materials as well as glass waste. The resulting frits were added in a ceramic body formulation (0, 1, 3, 5 wt.%). Phase composition, microstructure and technological properties of fired samples were evaluated and the results were compared to those obtained when using a standard commercial frit. According to water absorption tests, the novel products can be classified as BIa-type. Comparable or even improved technological properties were found between the standard body and the frit-bearing ones. More precisely, the addition of 5 wt.% of the novel frits led to better stain resistance as well as higher productivity due to reduction of the linear firing shrinkage. Improved mechanical strength (ca. 75 MPa compared to ca 60 MPa for the standard) was also obtained. The novel recycling route of KRY·AS supports a conclusive solution for the management of hazardous CA in Italy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cement-asbestos; Ceramic tiles; End of waste; Frit; Porcelain stoneware slabs; Secondary raw material","Asbestos cement; Cements; Clay; Concrete products; Glass ceramics; Hazards; Porcelain; Raw materials; Recycling; Shrinkage; Water absorption; Asbestos containing materials; Ceramic tile; Frit; Linear firing shrinkages; Porcelain stoneware; Secondary Raw Materials; Technological properties; Thermal transformations; Asbestos",,,,,"Ministero dell'Ambiente e della Tutela del Territorio e del Mare, MATTM: 22/12/17, Ric-Dec_2017_0000196","This work was financially supported by Ministero dell’Ambiente e della Tutela del Territorio e del Mare, Italy , Decr.

In order to promote the re-utilization of WFS, gene expression programming (GEP) has been employed in this study to develop empirical models for prediction of mechanical properties of concrete made with WFS (CMWFS). An extensive and reliable database of mechanical properties of CMWFS is established through a comprehensive literature review. The database comprises of 234 compressive strength, 163 split tensile strength and 85 elastic modulus results. The four most influential parameters i.e. water-to-cement ratio, WFS percentage, WFS-to-cement content ratio and fineness modulus of WFS are considered as the input parameters for modelling. The mechanical properties can be estimated by the application of proposed simplified mathematical expressions. The performance of the models is assessed by conducting parametric analysis, applying statistical checks and comparing with regression models. The results reflected that the proposed models are accurate and possess a high generalization and prediction capability. The findings of this study can enhance the re-usage of WFS for development of green concrete leading to environmental protection and monetary benefits. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Compressive strength; Gene expression programming; Green concrete; Split tensile strength; Waste foundry sand","Cements; Compressive strength; Concretes; Forecasting; Foundries; Gene expression; Hazardous materials; Metal casting; Metal castings; Pollution; Regression analysis; Tensile strength; Adverse environmental impacts; Gene expression programming; Green concrete; Mathematical expressions; Prediction of mechanical properties; Split tensile strengths; Waste foundry sands; Water to cement (binder) ratios; Foundry sand; concrete; water; compressive strength; concrete; elastic modulus; environmental protection; genetic algorithm; hazardous waste; industrial waste; performance assessment; prediction; sand; tensile strength; Article; chromosome; compressive strength; dangerous goods; DNA transposition; environmental impact; foundry; gene expression programming; genetic algorithm; genetic recombination; linear regression analysis; mutation rate; nonlinear regression analysis; physical parameters; prediction; statistical parameters; tensile strength; waste; waste foundry sand; Young modulus; algorithm; building material; chemistry; elasticity; gene expression regulation; green chemistry; industrial waste; mechanics; metallurgy; predictive value; recycling; sand; theoretical model; Algorithms; Compressive Strength; Construction Materials; Elasticity; Gene Expression Regulation; Green Chemistry Technology; Industrial Waste; Mechanical Phenomena; Metallurgy; Models, Theoretical; Predictive Value of Tests; Recycling; Sand; Tensile Strength; Waste Products; Water",,"water, 7732-18-5; Industrial Waste; Sand; Waste Products; Water",,,"2016YFC0701400; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51978396, U1633116; China Academy of Space Technology, CAST: 2018QNRC001; State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing: 2018CEM006; State Key Laboratory for Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering; Shanghai Rising-Star Program: 19QA1404700","This work was funded by the State's Key Project of Research and Development Plan [2016YFC0701400] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51978396, U1633116].

The manufactured blocks were evaluated for various characteristics as per ASTM C140/C140M, such as compressive strength, dry density and water absorption. Marble powder is obtained during sawing, cutting, shaping and polishing of marble, and it is normally rendered as solid waste. A huge quantity of discarded glass is dumped in landfills, world over. The mean dry densities of marble powder and glass powder used in this work are 2656.2 kg/m3 and 2547.4 kg/m3, respectively, making them lighter than ordinary cement. The optimum value is found to be 10% replacement of cement (by mass) by the waste materials. It is found that the compressive strength increases by 40% and 18%, dry density decreases by 4% and 5% and water absorption increases by 28% and 36%, if 10% cement is replaced by marble powder and glass powder, respectively. It can be concluded from the results that the non-load bearing hollow concrete blocks with improved compressive strength and light weight can be manufactured by using glass powder and marble powder. Recycling of solid wastes like marble powder and glass powder in concrete is advantageous: It will not only address the waste management issues, but will also result in saving the quantity of cement in concrete, which itself is environmentally hazardous material. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Concrete hollow blocks; Glass powder; Light weight; Marble powder; Strength","Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete industry; Glass; Glass industry; Green manufacturing; Industrial wastes; Marble; Solid wastes; Waste management; Water absorption; Glass Powder; Light weight; Management issues; Marble powder; Non-load bearings; Optimum value; Ordinary cements; Partial replacement; Concrete blocks",,,,,"Iran University of Science and Technology, IUST","This research was supported by the Office of Research Innovations and Commercialization (ORIC), Mirpur University of Science and Technology (MUST), Mirpur, AJ &K.

It has been reported that 75% of smokers dispose of their cigarette butts (CBs) on the ground, even in public places. Researchers have discovered that CBs make up more than one-third of the total littered waste on the planet. Cigarette butts predominantly consist of a cellulose acetate fiber (plastic)-based filter wrapped in paper. Waste CBs contain burnt tobacco and tar, along with many other toxic chemicals. They take years to biodegrade depending on the environmental conditions, and toxic chemicals leach out and contaminate the environment. As part of an ongoing project, this paper presents a novel and sustainable technique to recycle cigarette butts in bitumen for the construction of flexible pavements. In this research, CBs have been pre-processed and mixed with bitumen classes C320, C170, and PMB A10E as a fiber modifier. Comprehensive laboratory investigations, including a penetration test, softening point test, and viscosity test, have been performed along with a binder drain off test to evaluate the performance of the modified samples. During this investigation, samples were prepared with 0.3% cellulose fiber, 0.2%, 0.3% 0.4%, and 0.5% CBs. The results of the CB-modified samples were compared with the sample with cellulose fiber and fresh bitumen (0% fiber). The results show that the physical and rheological properties of bitumen incorporating CBs improve significantly, and CBs could be used instead of virgin cellulose fiber as a fiber modifier. © 2020 by the authors.","Asphalt concrete; Bitumen; Cigarette butts; Environmental sustainability; Recycling; Waste management","Asphalt concrete; Cellulose; Concretes; Electric circuit breakers; Environmental management; Recycling; Smoke; Sustainable development; Textile fibers; Tobacco; Bitumen; Cigarette butts; Environmental conditions; Environmental issues; Environmental sustainability; Flexible pavements; Laboratory investigations; Rheological property; Waste management; Bitumen; Cellulose; Recycling; Smoke; Textile Fibers; Tobacco",,,,,"RMIT University, RMIT","Acknowledgments: This work is part of an ongoing postgraduate study on recycling cigarette butts in bitumen and asphalt concrete.

Over 5 billion tons of non-hazardous solid waste materials are generated in Kuwait each year. Of these, more than 2 million scrap-tires (approximately 2 million tons) are generated each year. In addition to this, about 7 million scrap-tires have been stockpiled. Due to the increasingly serious environmental problems presented by waste tires, the feasibility of using elastic and flexible tire–rubber particles as aggregate in concrete is investigated in this study. Tire-rubber particles composed of tire chips, crumb rubber and a combination of tire chips and crumb rubber were used to replace mineral aggregates in concrete. These particles were used to replace 10, 15, 20 and 25% of the total mineral aggregate’s volume in concrete. Concrete cubes with dimensions of 100×100×100 mm3and prisms with dimensions of 75×75×300 mm3have been prepared and tested for their compressive strength. It was observed that, increasing the tire-rubber content, reduces the compressive strength, the unit weight and density of the concrete compared to plain concrete. Moreover, modulus of elasticity decreases as waste crumb tires replacement increases. The study concludes with useful comments and suggestions. © Medwell Journals, 2020","air content; compressive strength; recycling; solid; Tire-rubber; unit weight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2014) SP-017(14): The Reinforced Concrete Design Handbook, 1. , ACI., American Concrete Institute, Michigan, USA; (2016) Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318M-14), p. 519. , ACI., American Concrete Institute, Michigan, USA., ISBN: 9781942727118, Pages; (1988) Annual Book of ASTM Standards, , ASTM., 04.02, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USA; Bhogayata, A.C., Arora, N.K., Fresh and strength properties of concrete reinforced with metalized plastic waste fibers (2017) Constr.

However; the usage of plastic bottles is severe threat to environment in the form of plastic wastes. The rapid growth of PW is inviting attention for recycling and reusing in construction applications, which in turns to reduce the hazardous impact on environment. SCC is an influential innovation in concrete technology and overcome the application of normal concrete due to many attractive characteristics. Recently, the reinforcement of recycled plastic (RP) in SCC has increased due to many characteristics such as high workability, high liquidity and uniformity between the components of the mixture. Thus, this review work highlights the analyses of effect of RP fibres on SCC properties. On the basis of reviewed work in this paper, it can be concluded that the reinforcement of RP fibres could improve the fresh properties of SCC, whereas, in the hardened properties; the RP could enhance hardened properties of SCC to certain level but still lower than the steel reinforcement.

Although many studies have been conducted regarding construction waste recycling post-disasters, sustainable initiatives to integrate hazardous waste during reconstruction phases are often overlooked. For example, quarry rock dust (QRD), a hazardous waste obtained during the quarrying process, is a sustainable, economical, as well as more resilient alternative to sand in concrete structures, and improves the concrete's strength by ten percent. However, to date QRD is not effectively utilized in construction. The study utilizes the case study of a major earthquake that struck Nepal in 2015 and destroyed more than 491,620 buildings in 105 seconds. The post-disaster reconstruction phase encountered major challenges, especially related to construction raw material availability (like sand), thus delaying the reconstruction to more than three years. The two objectives of this study are to identify: (1) factors that impact the successful utilization of hazardous materials such as QRD and; (2) feasibility (in terms of cost, availability, and practicality) of integrating QRD, as the primary material in the reconstruction of infrastructures to accelerate the recovery phase in future disasters. To achieve these objectives, the research team conducted 115 semi-structured surveys to professionals who are actively working in post-disaster reconstruction in governmental and private organizations. The survey response was then, analyzed using linear regression analysis to determine the impact of identified factors on utilization of QRD in reconstruction. The results of the study: 1) provided post-disasters' lessons learned and; 2) generated preparedness activities that could be implemented in developing countries. Through this study, the research team was able to communicate with Nepal agencies to reconsider utilizing construction by-products in the aftermath of disasters, thereof accelerating the reconstruction phase. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Hazardous Waste; Quarry Rock Dust; Reconstruction; Sustainability","Developing countries; Disasters; Earthquakes; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Surveys; Sustainable development; Construction wastes; Hazardous wastes; Infrastructure systems; Material availability; Natural disasters; Post-disaster reconstruction; Primary materials; Private organizations; Concretes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bothara, J.K., Dhakal, R.P., Ingham, J.M., Dizhor, D., The challenges of housing reconstruction after the April 2015 gorkha, Nepal earthquake (2015) Technical Journal of Nepal's Engineers Association, pp. 121-131. , January; Devi, M., Kannan, K., Strength and corrosion resistive properties of concrete containing quarry dust as fine aggregate with ggbfs (2011) Advanced Materials Research, 243-249, pp. 5775-5778. , Trans Tech Publications; Ilangovana, R., Mahendrana, N., Nagamanib, K., Strength and durability properties of concrete containing quarry rock dust as fine aggregate (2008) ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 3 (5), pp. 20-26; Israel, G.D., Determining sample size (1992) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 38, pp. 607-610. , November; Kankam, C.K., Meisuh, B.K., Sossou, G., Buabin, T.K., Stress-strain characteristics of concrete containing quarry rock dust as partial replacement of sand (2017) Case Studies in Construction Materials, 7, pp. 66-72. , Elsevier May; Maxwell, O., Heavy metal contamination of soil by quarry dust at asonomaso in the ashanti region of Ghana (2015) Chemistry and Materials ResearchOnline), 7 (5), pp. 42-51; Memon, M.A., Disaster waste recovery and utilization in developing countries-learning from earthquakes in Nepal (2016) Japanese Geotechnical Society Special Publication, 2 (2), pp. 143-147; (2015) Nepal Earthquake 2015 Rapid Environment Assessment, , MoSTE/GoV Ministry of Science Technology and Environment; Pradhananga, P., Elzomor, M., Sustainable utilization of post disaster waste: A case study of Nepal earthquake (2019) IISE Annual Conference; Radikesh, P., Nanda, A.K.D.M.N., Stone crusher dust as a fine aggregate in concrete for paving blocks (2010) International Journal of Civil and Structural Engineering, 1 (3), pp. 613-620; Raghubanshi, U., Tamrakar, N.K., Construction material assessment from quarry sites at chaktan-ghasa-kaligandaki river area, western Nepal (2011) Bulletin of the Department of Geology, 14, pp. 77-82; Rai, D.C., Singhal, V., Raj, S.B., Sagar, S.L., Reconnaissance of the effects of the m7. 8 gorkha (Nepal) earthquake of April 25, 2015 (2016) Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk, 7 (1), pp. 1-17. , Taylor & Francis; Rimal, B., Zhang, L., Fu, D., Kunwar, R., Zhai, Y., Monitoring urban growth and the Nepal earthquake 2015 for sustainability of Kathmandu valley, Nepal (2017) Land, 6 (2), p. 42; Seville, E., Chang, Y., Wilkinson, S., Potangaroa, R., Brunsdon, D., An integrated approach: Managing resources for post-disaster reconstruction (2011) Disasters, 35 (4), pp. 739-765; Sharma, K., Apil, K.C., Subedi, M., Pokharel, B., Challenges for reconstruction after m w 7. 8 gorkha earthquake: A study on a devastated area of Nepal (2018) Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk, Taylor & Francis, 9 (1), pp. 760-790",,"El Asmar M.Tang P.Grau D.","Arizona State University;Construction Institute (CI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE);Construction Research Council","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","Construction Research Congress 2020: Infrastructure Systems and Sustainability","8 March 2020 through 10 March 2020",,164876,,9780784482858,,,"English","Constr.

In the concrete field, the use of industrial wastes for concrete materials is expected. However, these wastes may contain hazardous heavy metals. It is well known that heavy metal ions can be fixed in cement paste. However, it is also reported that lead adsorption on cement paste depends on pH value. This study aims to investigate lead adsorption on cement paste at various pH values controlled by different methods. The adsorption test was carried out at various pH values controlled by three methods, including carbonation of cement paste, calcium hydroxide leaching from cement paste, and cement paste immersion in nitric acid solutions at different concentrations. The concentration of lead ions after the adsorption test was measured by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. In addition, X-ray diffraction test was also employed to analyze chemical changes due to the pH value as well as lead fixation. The result showed that similar pH dependency of lead adsorption was found in every pH controlling method.

The waste plastic generation is increasing significantly on a daily basis. Through this review, we intend to find the efficient and feasible ways to reutilize the waste particles in hard-plastic waste as a bitumen modifier primarily for flexible pavements like bitumen and bituminous concrete roads. The use of waste plastic in recycled form in the pavement asphalt can serve as a valuable outlet for such type of waste materials. By using the concrete having modified bitumen mix along with processed waste plastic of about 5–10% by wt. of bitumen leads to a substantial improvement in the fatigue life, strength and other properties desirable in bituminous concrete. Consequently, it improves the service life and pavement performance with a marginal but significant saving in usage of bitumen in road construction. This process is certainly environment-friendly. Using waste plastics in the construction of pavements helps to consume large quantity of plastics which are hazardous waste. Thus, these processes also have high social and ecological relevance and contribute toward sustainable development. There are two processes to mix the plastic in surface layer of the road wet process and dry process. We are using wet mix process for the bitumen mix design by adding plastic waste and compare the results with the standard bitumen mix. We have chosen Marshall mix design for the calculation of grading and optimum bitumen and plastic content in mix. We are mainly focusing on surface layer of wearing course of about 50 mm thick, i.e., surface layer of road. This could be helpful in managing waste plastic while improving road quality and making them economical too. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bitumen concrete; Flexible pavement; Hard plastic; Marshall mix design","Asphalt concrete; Curricula; Elastomers; Grading; Pavements; Plastic recycling; Shotcreting; Sustainable development; Wear of materials; Bitumen modifiers; Ecological relevance; Environment friendly; Flexible pavements; Mix designs; Modified bitumen; Other properties; Pavement performance; Concrete mixtures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zoorob, S.E., Suparma, L.B., Laboratory design and investigation of the properties of continuously graded asphaltic concrete containing recycled plastics aggregate replacement (Plastisphalt) (2000) Cement Concr Compos, 22 (4), pp. 233-242; Chavan, M.A.J., Use of plastic waste in flexible pavements (2013) Int J Appl Innov Eng Mgmt, 2 (4), pp. 540-552; Gawande, A., Zamare, G., Renge, V.C., Tayde, S., Bharsakale, G., An overview on waste plastic utilization in asphalting of roads (2012) J Eng Res Stud, 3 (2), pp. 01-05; Kulkarni, S.J., Use of plastic in road construction material: Towards solid waste minimization (2017) Int J Recent Trends Eng Res, 3 (1)","Duggal, P.; Department of Civil Engineering, India; email: pduggal@amity.edu",,,"Springer",,,,,23662557,,,,"English","Lect.

Hundreds of varieties of plastic bags are used for packing and protecting general things. The disposal of PB is a prime environmental problem which significantly threatens the environment, as its disposal affects fertility of land due to its non-biodegradable nature; it lowers useful land area and generates toxic gases on incineration. Hence, there is a requirement of useful applications for these increased quantities of wastes. The usage of waste plastic bags (WPB) in concrete not only solve dumping crisis of WPB but also yields cost-effective concrete, which is worthy to both plastic recycling and construction industry. In this study, the influence of shredded WPB as fine aggregate on the properties of concrete was evaluated. The replacement of WPB was maintained at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% by weight of fine aggregate. The finding of the tested samples showed that the workability, density, compressive strength, flexural strength, static and dynamic modulus of elasticity of concrete samples decreased with increase in the WPB content, while penetrability to water increased. Microstructural analysis of the plastic waste concrete (PWC) specimens was carried out using scanning electron microscope. The microstructural studies indicated the presence of voids and openings between mortar matrix and WPB which was the main reason for the inferior properties of PWC. However, there has been a significant improvement in abrasion resistance, impact resistance and energy absorption capacity of PWC. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Abrasion resistance; Energy absorption capacity; Impact resistance; Microstructural analysis; Modulus of elasticity; Plastic bags","abrasion; absorption; concrete; incineration; microstructure; mortar; plastic waste; recycling; waste disposal",,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: DST/SSTP/Rajasthan/331","The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, for financial support of this study (No. DST/SSTP/Rajasthan/331).",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete, , American Concrete Institute and International Organization for Standardization; (1999) Measurement of Properties of Fiber Reinforced Concrete, , West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, United States; Albano, C., Camacho, N., Hernandez, M., Matheus, A., Gutierrez, A., Influence of content and particle size of waste pet bottles on concrete behavior at different w/c ratios (2009) Waste Management, 29, pp. 2707-2716. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXps1Clu7o%3D; AL-Hadithi, A.I., Hilal, N.N., The possibility of enhancing some properties of self-compacting concrete by adding waste plastic fibers (2016) Journal of Building Engineering, 8, pp. 20-28; Alqahtani, F.K., Khan, M.I., Ghataora, G., Dirar, S., Production of recycled plastic aggregates and its utilization in concrete (2016) Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 29, p. 04016248; AL-Tulaian, B.S., AL-Shannag, M.J., AL-Hozaimy, A.R., Recycled plastic waste fibers for reinforcing Portland cement mortar (2016) Construction and Building Materials, 127, pp. 102-110. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXntVagsL8%3D; (2014) Standard Test Method for Static Modulus of Elasticity and Poisson’s Ratio of Concrete in Compression, , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2016) Standard Test Method for Pulse Velocity through Concrete, , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; Bayasi, Z., Zeng, J., Properties of polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (1993) Materials Journal, 90, pp. 605-610. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK2cXislygtb0%3D; Bhogayata, A.C., Arora, N.K., Fresh and strength properties of concrete reinforced with metalized plastic waste fibers (2017) Construction and Building Materials, 146, pp. 455-463; Bhogayata, A., Arora, N., Feasibility study on usage of metalized plastic waste in concrete (2018) International Congress and exhibition” Sustainable Civil Infrastructures: Innovative Infrastructure Geotechnology, pp. 328-337. , 2018, Springer; Bhogayata, A., Shah, K., Arora, N., Strength properties of concrete containing post-consumer metalized plastic wastes (2013) International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology, 2, pp. 1-4; Bhogayata, A., Shah, K., Vyas, B., Arora, N., Performance of concrete by using non-recyclable plastic wastes as concrete constituent (2012) International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology, 1 (4), pp. 1-3; (2009) Guidelines for Concrete Mix Proportioning, , Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS), New Delhi, India; (2012) Cement Concrete Flooring Tiles-Specification, , Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS), New Delhi, India; (2016) Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS).

The leaching behavior of metals in the raw and solidification/stabilization (S/S) applied slag samples is evaluated with the toxicity characterization leaching procedure (TCLP). Then, TCLP results are compared to the threshold values given in USEPA Method 1311: 1992 and EU standard EN12457-4 2002 which suggest different pH values for TCLP. Raw slag sample were classified as hazardous waste according to USEPA and as non-hazardous according to EU-EN. The blocks which are produced by S/S applied slag with cement (slag ratio 25%—B25L and 50%—B50L) are classified as non-hazardous according to USEPA Method. However, the overall toxicity of blocks for B50L is classified as highly acute toxic (TU > 100 class 4). Therefore, B25L can be reused in the construction since it is not toxic and classified as high-quality concrete. It is suggested that appropriate waste management should be as follows: (1) spraying the acid solution to slag heap and collecting drained water in coagulation/flocculation tank, (2) recovery of lead (%3.3–4.0 Pb) and significant amount of iron (%18–25 Fe) from dried sludge and return to furnace and (3) S/S to slag for safer disposal to landfill or reuse of blocks as construction materials. Moreover, the results showed that toxicity test is a more convenient criterion to designate hazardous waste since it is directly reflecting the hazardous characteristics of waste. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Hazardous waste; Recovery; Recycling; Safer disposal; Stabilization/solidification; Toxicity","Electronic Waste; Hazards; Leaching; Metal recovery; Recovery; Recycling; Slags; Sludge disposal; Toxicity; Water conservation; Coagulation/flocculation; Disposal to landfills; Hazardous wastes; High-quality concrete; Solidification/stabilization; Spent lead acid batteries; Stabilization/solidification; Waste management strategies; Lead acid batteries; construction material; equipment; hazardous waste; landfill; leaching; recycling; slag; solidification; stabilization; strategic approach; toxicity; toxicity test; waste management",,,,,,"The financial support of Istanbul Technical University Scientific Research Project Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Solid wastes classification (2004) NBR, p. 10004. , (Resíduos sólidos e classificação; Bernardes, A.M., Espinosa, D.C.R., Tenório, J.A.S., Recycling of batteries: a review of current processes and technologies (2004) J Power Sources, 130, pp. 291-298; Bestgen, J.O., Cetin, B., Tanyu, B.F., Effects of extraction methods and factors on leaching of metals from recycled concrete aggregates (2016) Environ Sci Pollut Res, 23 (13), pp. 12983-13002; Chen, T.T., Dutrizac, J.E., The mineralogical characterization of lead-acid battery paste (1996) Hydrometallurgy, 40, pp. 223-245; Conner, J.R., Hoeffner, S.L., The history of stabilization/solidification technology (1998) Crit Rev Environ Sci Technol, 28 (4), pp. 325-396; Coya, B., Marañon, E., Sastre, B., Ecotoxicity assessment of slag generated in the process of recycling lead from waste batteries (2000) Resour Conserv Recycl, 29 (4), pp. 291-300; Coz, A., Andrés, A., Soriano, S., Environmental behavior of stabilized foundry sludge (2004) J Hazard Mater, 109, pp. 95-104; De Angelis, G., Medici, F., Montereali, M., Reuse of residues arising from lead batteries recycles: a feasibility study (2002) Waste Manag, 22 (8), pp. 925-930; Ellis, T.W., Mirza, A.H., The refining of secondary lead for use in advanced lead-acid batteries (2010) J Power Sources, 195, pp. 4525-4529; (2002), Characterization of waste-leaching-compliance test for leaching of granular waste materials and sludges—part 4: one stage batch test at a liquid to solid ratio of 10 l/kg for materials with particle size below 10 mm (without or with size reduction).

Consequently, nations around the world are investing considerable research effort into developing waste treatment and reduction solutions. Some areas have even enacted bans against the use of the material, however, in the Colombian case, it continues to be highly represented in the industry, and given the low cost of this packaging, little effort has been made to find a replacement. Expanded polystyrene is a thermoplastic polymer with low weight, low thermal conductivity, low cost, and low water absorption; factors which have made it a less attractive target for recycling. It has, however, excellent resistance to mechanical compression, which makes it viable for study in other applications such as those considered in the present study, offering advantages in terms of environmental protection without the need to completely eliminate the use of the material. The present study analyses the effects of integrating waste expanded polystyrene into the process of creating waterproofing paint. The research is divided into three major phases: the first focusing on the determination of the paint's technical requirements using previous research and by means of initial testing; the second, on elimination tests to validate the properties of various samples before preparing the final paint mixture; and finally, a third phase of final tests required for a waterproof paint. The final formula is applied to common materials in the construction sector, such as wood, metal, glass, and concrete, to validate each of the required properties. Among the main results, technical viability was identified in the second sample, which demonstrated the best results at a ratio of 1: 2.5: 2.5 of waste expanded polystyrene, D-limonene and methyl acetate, respectively. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Construction industry; Costs; Natural polymers; Natural resources management; Paint; Polystyrenes; Soil pollution; Soil testing; Water absorption; Water pollution; Water recycling; Waterproofing; Construction sectors; Environmental challenges; Expanded polystyrene; Low thermal conductivity; Mechanical compression; Technical requirement; Technical viability; Thermoplastic polymer; Waste treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Huang, J., Yin, X., Yang, J., Guo, M., (2014) Mater.

Tire waste is one of them that cause serious environmental issues because of the rapid rise in and numerous variations of modern developments worldwide. Thus, recycling waste tire rubber in the form of aggregates as supplementary construction material is advantageous. This paper reviews the source of waste tire rubbers and rubberized cementitious composites along with their material properties, usages, durability, and serviceability performances. This study also aims to provide a fundamental insight into the integrated applications of rubberized concrete (RuC) composite materials to improve construction methods, including applications to enhance environmental sustainability of concrete structures in the construction industry. Inclusion of recycled rubber aggregate (RA) lightens concrete, increases its fatigue life and toughness, advances its dynamic properties, and improves its ductility. Concrete with recycled RA performs well in hot and cold weather and achieved significant results under critical exposure and various loading conditions. Though RuC possesses low mechanical strength in general, specific treatment and additives inclusion can be a good solution to improve those properties reliably. Investigations of RuC as materials are available significantly, but researches on the structural members of RuC should be enriched. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Durability; Mechanical performance; Recycled rubber aggregate; Rubberized concrete; Waste tire","Additives; Aggregates; Concretes; Construction industry; Durability; Glass ceramics; Recycling; Sustainable development; Tires; Cementitious composites; Environmental issues; Environmental sustainability; Integrated applications; Mechanical performance; Recycled rubber; Rubberized concrete; Waste tires; Ruthenium compounds",,,,,"Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, PSAU","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University , Saudi Arabia.",,,,,,,,,,,"Raffoul, S., Garcia, R., Escolano-Margarit, D., Guadagnini, M., Hajirasouliha, I., Pilakoutas, K., Behaviour of unconfined and FRP-confined rubberised concrete in axial compression (2017) Constr.

In the past, asbestos was widely used, together with cement, to produce ""asbestos cement-based"" products. During the recycling process of Construction and Demolition waste (C&DW), ACM must be collected and deposited separately from other wastes. One of the main aims of the recycling strategies applied to C&DW was thus to identify and separate ACM from C&DW (e.g., concrete and brick). However, to obtain a correct recovery of C&DW materials, control methodologies are necessary to evaluate the quality and the presence of harmful materials, such as ACM. HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI)-based sensing devices allow performing the full detection of materials constituting demolition waste. ACMs are, in fact, characterized by a spectral response that nakes them is dierent from the ""simple"" matrix of the material/s not embedding asbestos. The described HSI quality control approach is based on the utilization of a platform working in the short-wave infrared range (1000-2500 nm). The acquired hyperspectral images were analyzed by applying different chemometric methods: Principal Component Analysis for data exploration and hierarchical Partial Least-Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to build classification models. Following this approach, it was possible to set up a repeatable, reliable and efficient technique able to detect ACM presence inside a C&DW flow stream. Results showed that it is possible to discriminate and identify ACM inside C&DW. The recognition is potentially automatic, non-destructive and does not need any contact with the investigated products. © 2019 by the authors.

Steel slag can be profitably used as a road surface layer, for foundations and embankments, or for concrete aggregates. However, a strong limitation to their use is due to the presence of toxic metals (Ba, Cr, V, Mo, etc.) that can be released into the environment in particular conditions, especially for unbound products in which the slag can come into contact with water. Recent studies have investigated the role of chemical composition and microstructure of slag on toxic metal leaching, allowing for the design of suitable stabilization treatments for hindering such leaching. In this work, four batches of electric arc furnace carbon steel slag underwent a stabilization treatment and the obtained results were compared. In two batches, the stabilizer was added directly in the slag pot and the slag was cooled down in the same pot. The other two batches were stabilized during the downfall from slag door to slag pit. Several slag samples were collected before and after the stabilization treatment and were characterized by means of ED-XRF, XRD, and SEM analysis. Leaching tests were carried out in agreement with EN 12457-2 standard on 4 mm granulated slag, and the leachate concentration was compared with the current Italian limits listed in D.M. 3 August 2005 N. 201 and D.M. 5 April 2006 N. 186. The results clearly indicated that the cooling in the slag pot improved the efficiency of the stabilization treatment, leading to a complete transformation of the microstructure by a full development of homogeneous gehlenite matrix and a coarsening of Cr-spinels, assuring better toxic metal retention behavior. On the contrary, stabilization in the slag-pit was rapid and reduced the interaction between slag and stabilizer, leading only to partial transformation of larnite into gehlenite, and also reducing the coarsening of Cr-spinel. In addition, a layering effect was observed, resulting in an inhomogeneous product from top to bottom in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, and leaching behavior. © 2019 by the authors.

Comprehensive treatment required to treat UBEC as hazardous waste. This research tested the physical and chemical characteristics of UBEC to acknowledge its potential as engine fuel, and then UBEC was combusted in rotary kiln as refuse derived fuel (RDF). The bottom ash from the combustion process was used as fine aggregate replacement in concrete K350 production, compressive strength and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was analyzed. UBEC consists of bleaching earth material (Monmorillonite 53.3% and Klinoptilolith 40%), oil residue, and impurities (heavy metals, carbon residue, etc.). Its calorific value ranges from 3000 to 5000 calories and meet the standards for being used as RDF. The average compressive strength result by replacing fine aggregate with 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of its ashes were 31.88 MPa, 34.15 MPa, 38.45 MPa, 37.66 MPa, and 36.69 MPa, respectively. The highest compressive strength was at 10% of replacement. TCLP results still meet the standard. Overall, UBEC can be use as RDF and its bottom ash can be safely use as replacement for fine aggregates in concrete K350 production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aggregates; Ash handling; Ashes; Bleaching; Cleaning; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Geophysics; Heavy metals; Lubricating oils; Recycling; Refuse derived fuels; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Bleaching earths; Carbon residue; Combustion pro-cess; Fine aggregates; Hazardous wastes; Monmorillonite; Physical and chemical characteristics; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedures; Compressive strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Dokumen Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan (Cikande, Serang, Banten), , Bintangmas Cahaya Internasional, PT; (2011) Cara Uji Kuat Tekan Beton Dengan Benda Uji Silinder, , SNI 1974:2011 (Indonesia: Badan Standarisasi Nasional); (2012) Tata Cara Perhitungan Harga Satuan Pekerjaan Beton Precetak Untuk Konstruksi Bangunan Gedung, , SNI 7832:2012 (Indonesia: Badan Standarisasi Nasional); Siong Gan, K., Cheong Peng, C., (2003) Incineration Bottom Ash As Raw Materials for Concrete Products, , (Singapore: Nanyang Technological University); Mokrzcki, E., Uliasz, B.A., Sarna, M., Use of alternative fuel in the Polish cement (2003) Industry Applied Energy, 74 (1-2), pp. 101-111; Gendebien, A., Leavens, A., Blackmore, K., Refuse Derived Fuel, Current Practice and Perspective Final Report (2003) WRc Plc Wiltshire; Jayanti, S., Maheswaran, K., Saravan, V., Assessment of the effect of high ash content in pulverized coal combustion (2007) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 31 (5), pp. 934-953; William, A.D., Howie, R.A., Wise, W.S., Rock-Forming Material Framework Silicates: Silica Minerals, Feldspathoids and Zeolites (2004) Geological Society, , Preprint. 22 Retrieved 2 January 2012; Shetty, M.S., (2005) Concrete Technology, Theory and Practice, 6. , (S.

However, feedstuffs became difficult due to the inability to prevent toxic substances, and composting was reluctant to use inappropriately and excessively salty. Therefore, using food waste as its own heat source in the drying process will reduce fuel costs and provide new food treatment methods. The food waste that is rich in fat and protein is distilled and dried, the solid material is used as livestock feed, and the condensate is completely recycled as an external carbon source of deodorant or sewage treatment plant. At this time, the excess solid component is pyrolyzed in a vertical type carburetor, and a combustible gas is produced and burned to be utilized as a heat source of the food drying apparatus. The pyrolysis temperature of the dried food waste for making flammable gas was maintained at 400 ° C and in this case, the harmful gas was below the environmental standard. By maintaining 1200 ° C during combustion, the risk of dioxin was eliminated. The vertical carbonization system can be used as a solid fuel additive, a black gray concrete additive, a soil additive and the like, while the hydrocarbon gas produced by pyrolyzing the solid structure effectively is used as a clean fuel to reduce the fuel cost. Condensate is used as an external carbon source for liquid fertilizers, deodorizers and sewage treatment. This device is not necessary when using incinerator waste heat. In a food waste disposal facility in an area without an incinerator, the fuel can be self-sufficient and effectively reduce fuel costs. © BEIESP.","Animal food; Food waste; Organic waste; Recycling; Steam heating",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Han, D.H., Park, S.-J., A Study on Compost of Food Waste by Salt Minimization (2004) Journal of the Korea Academia - Industrial Cooperation Society, 5 (2), pp. 118-122; Han, D.H., (2005) Development of Food Waste Fermentation System by Low Water-Ratio Salt Minimization, 6 (2), pp. 189-194; Han, D.H., Recycling Apparatus of Organic Wastes by Direct Steam Heating (2007) Proceedings of KAIS Spring Conference, pp. 294-296; Han, D.H., Development of Perfect Recycling Equipment for Sea Fish Waste (2010) Journal of the Korea Academia, 11 (2), pp. 614-619. , Industrial cooperation Society; Han, D.H., Salt Reduction for Compositing of Food Waste (2014) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 9 (21), pp. 9177-9184; Han, D.H., A Study on the Recycling of Lungfishes Proceeding of The 2nd, , ICSMB2015; Han, D.H., A Recycling Method of Rotten Fish Wastes (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8, p. 22; Downing, E., Carr, W., (2015) Food Waste, House of Commons Library, , briefing paper number CBP07045, 10 June; Han, D.H., Liquid separator for livestock manure by dual raw separation equipment (2017) Proceeding of ICCT2017; Han, D.H., A Recycling Method of Food Waste by Drying and Fuelizing (2017) Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 12 (14), pp. 3599-3603; Min, B.-W., (2008) Waste Materials Treating Process and Apparatus for Batch Type Drying and Vertical Type Carbonizing, , Korean Patent No. 100845131; Libra, J.A., Ro, K.S., Kammann, C., Funke, A., Berge, N.D., Neubauer, Y., Titirici, M.-M., Kern, J., Karl-Heinz Emmerich1Hydrothermal carbonization of biomass residuals: A comparative review of the chemistry, processes and applications of wet and dry pyrolysis (2011) Biofuels, 2 (1), pp. 89-124","Han, D.H.; ITCRI, South Korea; email: hanknu@hanmail.net",,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

Secondary alkaline lead slag is a hazardous waste generated in the recycling process of lead-acid batteries that may be suitable in construction materials. The environmental impact of the use of lead slag as a partial replacement of fine aggregates in the cement-based stabilization/solidification (S/S) process for the preparation of concrete was studied in this paper. Solidified products containing 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% slag were laboratory tested by unconfined compressive strength (UCS) analyses and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). At the same time, the leachability of toxic elements from solidified products with a high percent of slag was evaluated under environmental conditions for during one year. The results of the UCS and TCLP indicated that utilization of this type of slag in cement-based applications may be justified with its controlled addition. However, the described application of the slag was disputed due to the high release of As under high alkaline environmental conditions. Eh-pH analyses and the geochemical modeling using the software PHREEQC were evaluated, as well as the mechanism of pollutant (Pb, As) immobilization (precipitation, adsorption) as a function of pH conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the implementation of this approach is still limited by most guidelines due principally to insufficient knowledge of these materials performances and to unjustified presumptions related to their chemical instability (presence of sulfide). This paper approaches these issues by assessing the reuse potential of low-sulfide mining waste-rocks as aggregates for concrete regarding to the Quebec (Canada) recycling guidelines of non-hazardous inorganic wastes as construction materials. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), comprehensive physical, chemical (XRF and ICP-AES) and mineralogical investigations (XRD and SEM) as well as modern automated mineral liberation analyses have been carried out. In addition, UCS results of various concrete mixtures using different binders were then presented to illustrate the reuse potential of the waste-rocks. The TCLP test showed the nonhazardous character of the waste rocks. They contained low sulfide content (0.5 wt%), which classify them as non-acid generating and able to meet the classification in recycling category including concrete production. Moreover, liberation analyses showed that most sulfides are concentrated in the fine fraction as pyrite occurrence with a liberated fraction of only 2%. These results influenced significantly the properties of the resulting concretes, which presented good mechanical performances especially when coarse waste rock above 20 mm and fine one below 80 μm was removed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregate; Compressive strength; Concrete; Mine wastes; Mineral liberation analysis; Reuse potential; Waste management","Aggregates; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Chemical analysis; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Concretes; Pyrites; Recycling; Rocks; Solid wastes; Sulfur compounds; Concrete productions; Materials performance; Mechanical performance; Mine wastes; Mineral liberation analysis; Preliminary assessment; Reuse potential; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedures; Waste management",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .

Considering the scarcity of raw materials in many parts of the planet and unique properties of WTS, extensive research has been conducted on the application of WTS in the production of construction materials such as roof tiles, bricks, lightweight aggregates, cement, concrete and geopolymers. This paper critically reviews the progress in the application of WTS in construction materials, by synthesizing results from recent studies. Research findings have revealed that incorporation of ≤10% alum-based sludge in ceramic bricks is satisfactory with a small reduction of mechanical performance. Using the iron-based sludge, the bricks presented better mechanical strength than the reference clay-bricks. Concerning WTS application in concrete, 5% replacement of cement or sand by WTS was considered as the ideal value for the application in a variety of structural and non-structural concrete without adverse effect on concrete mechanical performance. Furthermore, this paper discusses sludge-amended concrete in terms of durability, potential leaching of toxic elements and cost, and suggests topics for future research on the sustainable management of WTS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Construction materials; Durability; Mechanical properties; Solid waste recycling; Water treatment sludge","Brick; Building materials; Cements; Chemical water treatment; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Durability; Roofs; Waste treatment; Water recycling; Light weight aggregate; Mechanical performance; Non-structural concretes; Reference clays; Small reduction; Solid waste recycling; Sustainable management; Water treatment sludge; Mechanical properties; cement; concrete; construction material; durability; manufacturing; mechanical property; recycling; sludge; solid waste; water treatment; ceramic brick; clinical evaluation; cost benefit analysis; environmental economics; environmental impact; human; leaching; lightweight aggregate; manufacturing industry; paving tile; Review; sand; synthesis; waste water management",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship, Australia , in the form of a Masters by research grant (Samuel De Carvalho Gomes).

The current review manuscript represents an endeavour to reassess applications of abandoned electrical and electronic wastes, i.e. E-wastes, as supplementary material to develop a variety of green concretes for construction and infrastructure industries. The principal objective of this piece of review writing includes an existing and state of the art knowledge of these modern, complex, valuable but hazardous elements enclosing wastes by employing them as substitution of natural fine or coarse aggregates in concrete manufacturing. This is a new-fangled, an innovative and revolutionary concept in the direction of development of sustainable and cost-effective green concretes. Not only that, physical, chemical and metallurgical recycling processes of E-wastes, their advantages and disadvantages with thermal, strength, and durability parameters of E-wastes incorporated green concrete, as well as impacts of hazardous substances, have also been assessed. This paper also flashes a light not merely on an application of E-wastes glass of cathode ray tubes with cement paste, mortar and concrete but also an appraisal of the utilization of E-wastes materials in a bituminous mix. Also, the use of non-biodegradable recovered E-wastes plastics is reviewed as partial substitution of natural coarse or fine ingredients through this “Urban Mining” approach. This review will lend a hand to promote sustainable and affordable development of green concrete incorporating E-wastes in the construction industry and help to resolve the impasses of degradation of natural restricted aggregate resources as well as contaminations of environment, soil, and groundwater due to landfilling and of course, to safeguard the health of lives on the globe. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cathode ray tube (CRT); Electrical and electronic wastes (E-wastes); Printed circuit board (PCB); Voids filled by bitumen (VFB); Voids of mineral aggregates (VMA); Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)","Aggregates; Biodegradable polymers; Bituminous materials; Cathode ray tubes; Cathode rays; Cathodes; Cement industry; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hazards; Oscillators (electronic); Portland cement; Printed circuit boards; Recycling; Sustainable development; Waste utilization; Electrical and electronic wastes; Mineral aggregate; Printed circuit boards (PCB); Voids filled by bitumen (VFB); Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Electronic Waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Luthar, B., Kropivnik, S., Class, cultural capital, and the mobile phone (2011) Czech Sociol.

This study first attempted to reutilize IBA for synthesis of a novel aerated concrete by hydrothermal reaction. Moreover, impact of hydrothermal process on heavy metal bioleaching behavior of the synthesized material was investigated. Concrete specimens were prepared by optimum reuse of 20% IBA with replacement of cement in the mix matrix, then treated hydrothermally. A series of well-designed bioleaching experiments were carried out on samples of raw IBA, untreated and hydrothermally treated concretes in synthetic groundwater media using an environmental bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The findings demonstrated that interactions between bacteria (strain PAO1) and IBA/concretes accelerated heavy metal leaching. Nonetheless, hydrothermal treatment has dramatic effects on immobilization of heavy metals because significant reduction (29–100%) of toxic metal (Cu, As, Pb and Cr) bioleaching observed. FE-SEM depicted a clear morphology change with plate, fibrous and needle-like structures, whereas XRD pattern indicated possible formation of a new calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) containing mineral (tobermorite) by hydrothermal reaction, and tobermorite might cause fixing of heavy metals by structural exchange of Ca 2+ by metal ions. This study suggests production of construction materials using IBA by hydrothermal process could be an attractive option for recycling of IBA or similar properties of wastes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Autoclaved aerated concrete; Biological leaching; Heavy metal immobilization; Hydrothermal process; Incineration bottom ash (IBA); Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1","Ash handling; Ashes; Bacteria; Bioleaching; Calcium silicate; Concretes; Groundwater; Heavy metals; Hydrothermal synthesis; Metal ions; Municipal solid waste; Plate metal; Recycling; Silicate minerals; Structural metals; Water treatment; Autoclaved aerated concrete; Biological leaching; Bottom ash; Heavy metal immobilization; Hydrothermal process; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Waste incineration",,,,,"ETRP 1301 104; Environment Agency, EA; Nanyang Technological University, NTU","The authors would like to acknowledge support from the Environment Technology Research Program (ETRP), National Environment Agency, Singapore (Project No. ETRP 1301 104).

An advanced recycling technology based on pyrometallurgical treatment using Au concentrate as a flux material was developed in this study. The benefits of employing roasted gold concentrate (RGC) in the smelting process of waste PCBs were demonstrated through high-temperature experiments. The major oxide compositions of PCBs (CaO, Al2O3, and SiO2) were fluxed using oxidized Au concentrate composed of FetO and SiO2. Quaternary slag systems (CaO-FetO-Al2O3-SiO2) were formed during the smelting process, which rendered the process of separation of oxide impurities from Cu-based alloys easier. Precious metals (Au and Ag) were effectively recovered from waste PCBs and Au concentrate in the form of a metal alloy that required further treatment by leaching and extraction. Residual S in the RGC significantly changed the alloy phases. A large quantity of S was formulated into a matte phase, while a small amount of S was dissolved into a Cu-Fe metal alloy. The subsequent hydrometallurgical process was optional. Electrorefining or pressure leaching could be applied depending on the type of Cu alloy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Flux; Gold concentrate; Precious metals; Printed circuit boards; Smelting","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Extraction; Fluxes; Gold; Iron alloys; Leaching; Metal recovery; Precious metal alloys; Precious metals; Pyrometallurgy; Silica; Slags; Smelting; Timing circuits; Toxic materials; Waste treatment; Gold concentrate; Hazardous substances; High-temperature experiments; Hydrometallurgical process; Pyrometallurgical treatments; Recycling technology; Waste printed circuit board; Waste printed circuit board (PCBs); Printed circuit boards; alloy; aluminum oxide; calcium oxide; copper; gold; iron; lead; silicon; silicon dioxide; silver; tin; zinc; alloy; concrete; copper; experimental study; extraction method; flux measurement; gold; high temperature; leaching; metal; Quaternary; slag; smelting; Article; bioleaching; dangerous goods; electronic waste; high temperature; leaching; metal extraction; metal recovery; recycling; slag; thermodynamics; waste; waste printed circuit board",,"aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; gold, 7440-57-5; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; silicon, 7440-21-3; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; silver, 7440-22-4; tin, 14314-35-3, 7440-31-5; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, KIGAM","The research was supported by the Basic Research Project [grant number GP2018-025 ] of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning of Korea .",,,,,,,,,,"Ogunseitan, O.A., The Basel Convention and e-waste: translation of scientific uncertainty to protective policy (2013) Lancet Glob.

Consequently, the environmental and health issue related to ore extraction has led to an increased awareness of the importance of recovering mining sites. In this study, samples taken from tailings located in the abandoned metallic mine named La Unión (Mazarambroz, Spain) have been studied to sinter lightweight aggregates (LWAs). The fraction <63 μm was selected and mixed with 10 wt% of a sepiolite residue to gain plasticity. Likewise, 2.5 wt% of thermoplastic (P) and 2.5 wt% of carbon fiber (FC) wastes were added in powder form to check the effect of these two additives. The mixtures were blended with water, extruded, shaped into pellets, oven-dried and finally fired at 1175 °C for 4 min in a rotary kiln. The main technological properties of the aggregates related to bloating, density, porosity, loss on ignition, water absorption and mechanical strength were determined. Quantitative changes in mineralogy and glass formation were studied using the Rietveld refined XRD technique. Microstructural and textural characteristics were studied by microscopy. Dark color LWAs of high porosity, low density and good mechanical strength were obtained. The addition of P ad FC allowed the development of a well-distributed-porous core surrounded by a very thin shell, in contrast to the thick cortex formed when these components were not used. While the addition of FC did not mean real advantages in the technological properties, P promoted greater bloating and lower density. A high volume of glass was evolved in all the aggregates (≥60%) and augite was the main neo-formed mineral. Pyrrotite was also neo-formed, but its proportion was negligible to be detected by XRD, so that it could be only observed by SEM-EDX microscopy. These results are encouraging to continue investigating these wastes and the aggregates manufactured from them in order to determine their capacity to immobilize hazardous metals and their potential application in lightweight concrete, agriculture or civil engineering. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy metals; Lightweight aggregate; Mining; Polymer; Tailing; Waste recycling","Abandoned mines; Additives; Carbon fibers; Concrete aggregates; Glass; Heavy metals; Light weight concrete; Minerals; Mining; Ore treatment; Polymers; Porosity; Tailings; Water absorption; X ray diffraction; Human food chain; Light weight aggregate; Loss on ignition; Mining activities; Quantitative changes; Technological properties; Textural characteristic; Waste recycling; Aggregates",,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF: 2016/12998, DOCM 2014/10620; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM: 7911/2014","This research has been supported by the research project PEII - 2014-025 -P of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha and the PhD grant number PRE- 7911/2014 whose funds come from the Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes of JCCM and the European Social Fund (DOCM 2014/10620 and DOCM 2016/12998 BDNS (Identif.): 323799 .).

In this regard; research was conducted on the reuse of WG to make economic benefit, to prevent accumulation of WG, to contribute to the environment by helping in the formation of new materials from waste material, and the use of WG, which would generate hazardous radioactive gas to human health, in concrete production. Thus, the cementitious materials that will be obtained shall be environment-friendly, economic, and helpful in the isolation of hazardous radioactive wastes. Therefore, within the scope of this study, it was investigated whether semi-green cementitious materials obtained from recycling WG would have the mechanical characteristics to satisfy the requirements, and have equivalent or even surpassing characteristics compared to materials made from classic materials. The results were obtained at a substitution rate of 5–7.5%; when recycled WG was used in place of aggregate, the results were obtained at a substitution rate of 15–25%; and when recycled WG was used in place of coarse aggregate, it gave better performance than recycled normal concrete aggregate and worse performance than crushed quartzite coarse aggregate. Furthermore, in terms of economy, it was determined that the utilization of WG would decrease costs by a minimum of 0.54% and a maximum of 2.1%; while with respect to CO 2 emissions, the use of WG could decrease worldwide CO 2 emission by 5%. Also, it was determined that the best solution for granite, which could cause gas emissions of hazardous gases such as radon gas, would be to be used in concrete that would be exposed to open air. © 2018 fib.

Structural, surface and chemical properties of adsorbents were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Specific surface area (SBET) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adsorption experiments ran in a batch manner at laboratory temperature (20°C) with the model solutions of toxic ions. The modification of CSW with FeII increased its adsorption selectivity to anions about 20% at a lower sorbent consumption.

During recycling of the scrap iron about 15– 20% of dust is generated. EAFD is considered as hazardous waste material by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to presence of heavy metals in high concentration. Major quantity of this waste material is disposed in land and some part of it is used for recycling of steel and zinc recovery. EAFD is highly leachable in nature mainly due to Lead(Pb) and other elements like Selenium (Se) and Antimony(Sb) present in it. With the insufficiency of area for land filling and its increasing prices for disposal, alternative is to utilize this waste. Many literatures are published on the usability of EAFD in concrete, which concludes that use of EAFD improves the mechanical properties of concrete. This paper provides a detailed review about properties of EAFD and its effect on the mechanical properties of concrete. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Concrete; Electric arc furnace dust; Partial replacement of cement Hazardous waste","Dust control; Electric arcs; Electric furnace process; Electric furnaces; Environmental Protection Agency; Heavy metals; Iron scrap; Mechanical properties; Metallurgical furnaces; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel scrap; Waste disposal; Zinc metallurgy; Electric arc furnace dust; Hazardous waste materials; Land-fillings; Properties of concretes; Scrap irons; Scrap melting; Zinc recovery; Concretes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Zaid, RZ, Al-Sugair, FH, Al-Negheimish, AI, Investigation of potential uses of electric-arc furnace dust (EAFD) in concrete (1997) Cem Concr Res, 27 (2), pp. 267-278; (1992) Standards section-4 construction ASTM Philadelphia, , American Society for Testing and Materials; Besta, P, Samolejová, A, Janovská, K, Lenort, R, Haverland, J, (2012) The effect of harmful elements in production of iron in relation to input and output material balance; Guézennec, AG, Huber, JC, Patisson, F, Sessiecq, P, Birat, JP, Ablitzer, D, Dust formation in electric arc furnace: birth of the particles (2005) Powder Technol, 157 (1–3), pp. 2-11; Hw, G, Stoesser, K, Denecke, H, Schemmann, V, Environmental aspects and recycling of filter dusts by direct injection or use of agglomerates in shaft furnaces (2000) ISIJ Int, 40 (3), pp. 218-223; Kashiwaya, Y, Tsubone, A, Ishii, K, Sasamoto, H, Thermodynamic analysis on the dust generation from EAF for the recycling of dust (2004) ISIJ Int, 44 (10), pp. 1774-1779; Ma, NY, On In Process Separation of Zinc from EAF Dust (2011) EPD Congress 2011, pp. 947-952. , (February) –).

These materials are classified as dangerous waste and need to be disposed at high costs. However, the generated waste streams still contain highly valued metals which cannot be recovered through traditional methods. This results in a definite loss of resources which could otherwise be reused in the market. Therefore, a recycling solution for such materials is of outmost importance. Cronimet Envirotec developed a new process and built the first plant worldwide which recycles oily metal sludges without compromising the overall product quality. With its vacuum distillation process, it is possible to fully recover the metal fraction and separate it from oil, water and other contaminants. The overall process runs under an inert atmosphere hindering any oxidation reactions of the metals. As a result, no further post-treatment is needed before using the obtained products in other steps of the value chain. In the past years Cronimet Envirotec was able to gain experience in recycling a large variety of metal slurries such as high-speed steel (HSS)-, stainless- and iron-sludge. Overall it can be said that with its novel and innovative process, Cronimet Envirotec has helped adding sustainability to the metal production sector. Its process helps recover valuable resources and contributes to stable raw material prices. The paper depicts how the Envirotec process differs from traditional ways of disposal and how it adds value to the industry. Concrete examples of metal sludges are given and further areas for application of this process, like spent catalysts and oil-based muds, are briefly introduced. © Proceedings of the 10th European Metallurgical Conference, EMC 2019.

Spent toner cartridges are classified as hazardous waste because they contain toner powder with specific chemical composition, making a recovery of waste toner cartridges a very important issue from the aspect of waste management and environmental protection. Spent toner cartridges are mechanically processed to exploit valuable materials such as metals, plastics and magnets and to separate toner powder as a toxic waste. In this work, the use of waste toner powder as an additive in concrete was studied. The toner powder was mixed with calcium-based additive in ratio 50:50 immediately after the mechanical treatment. The resulting mixture (hereafter: WTP) was added to concrete at different percentages (1%, 3,%, 5% and 10%) as a replacement for fine aggregate. All processes were performed on industrial scale. The addition of 1% and 3% of WTP lead to a concrete with the optimal properties. The possible impact on the environment was studied by the means of leaching test using valid regulations for a landfill. The modified concrete with 1%, 3%, 5% WTP can be classified as inert waste. © 2019 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Within this context, this study aims to give a second life cycle to phosphogypsum (PG) waste, which is a byproduct from phosphoric acid manufacture, as useful resources. This study evaluates the sustainability of this harmful waste, which is accumulated in large stockpiles and becomes hazardous during storage, and to stabilize bentonite-based concrete intended for road construction. The effect of raw bentonite (Ca-Na montmorillonite), PG, and lime on the properties of cementitious materials has been investigated through various tests. The properties examined include chemistry (X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry), mineralogy (X-ray Powder Diffraction and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), calorimetry (Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermogravimetry) and microstructure (Scanning Electron Microscopy) of the mortar based on different mixtures of bentonite, PG and lime. The result show that lime and PG addition involves in the formation of new nanocrystalline phases and the disappearance of certain minerals as portlandite. Calcium silicate hydrate gel appeared in the mixture with 8% of lime, whereas strätlingite was neoformed in the mixture with 8% of lime and 8% of PG. These nanocrystalline phases are responsible for enhancing mechanical strength through the pozzoloanic reaction. © The Author(s).","Bentonite; CSH gel; Microstructure; Phosphogypsum; Strätlingite","Additives; Bentonite; Binary alloys; Calcium alloys; Calcium silicate; Differential thermal analysis; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gypsum; Hydrated lime; Life cycle; Microstructure; Mixtures; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanocrystals; Phosphoric acid; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicates; Sodium alloys; Sodium metallography; X ray powder diffraction; X rays; Calcium silicate hydrate gel; Cementitious materials; Circular economy; Lime stabilization; Na-montmorillonite; Nanocrystalline phasis; Phosphogypsum; X ray fluorescence spectrometry; Lime",,,,,,"This research was supported by 2 Erasmus grants from the University of Liege to Safae OUMNIH and Nadia BEKKOUCH.

Large-scale utilization of products from waste water purification in the composition of building materials has traditionally been limited given that heavy metal compounds are included in the composition of waste. Materials that are created using such a waste are traditionally considered to be dangerous for human health and the environment. Application of alkaline cements as matrices for binding these wastes and related products makes it possible to solve the task on reliable binding of heavy metals. It was experimentally determined that the main crystalline phases are calcite, quartz, hematite, coesite, and diopside. Also defined is the presence of gelatinous neo formations that are capable of subsequent recrystallization into zeolite-like structures. Such a composition of neo formations provides the involvement of heavy metal ions into the structure of the received material. Compressive strength of alkaline-activated systems that employ water treatment products (industrial wastes of galvanic production) reaches 40 MPa in standard mortars. Application of the developed cements in concretes makes it possible to achieve the strength of 45 MPa without changing the technological process of concrete preparation. The leaching of heavy metals from the matrix of alkaline cements was studied following the aging of up to 28 days by using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The study performed has shown that the alkaline cement matrix is characterized by high immobilizing properties relative to the heavy metal compounds (the level of immobilization of heavy metals ions is up to 99 %) and allows the use of industrial waste water purification products in the composition of alkaline cements and concretes based on them. Application of such an approach will not only solve the environmental problems related to disposing of hazardous products from water treatment, but would also make it possible to obtain building materials for general purposes with high operational properties. © O.

The negative side of the picture is that it is nonbiodegradable product and they cannot be disposed to open environment, because they affect the environment, soil, and subsoil. They release toxic gasses when exposed to open environment and can block sewer lines, drainages, and other waterways. Plastics are also harmful to human health; they may contain or lead to harmful acids. Thus, recycling of plastic is essential in today’s condition. Incorporating the waste plastics in concrete by converting them into aggregates is one of the possible solutions to consume them.

Serious issues are mostly connected to the sustainable management of these wastes from a technical, environmental and policy levels. In the present study, the recycling potential of gold mining waste rocks as construction materials has been investigated according to Quebec (Canada) recycling guidelines of non-hazardous inorganic wastes based on a scientific point of view. Waste rocks were collected from a gold mining site (Quebec, Canada) and prepared using crushing and sieving methods. Acid generation potential, chemical analysis, mineralogy and pollution potential of waste rocks were assessed. Concrete mixtures were then prepared using crushed waste rocks and their mechanical performances and environmental properties were evaluated. The results showed that waste rocks sample contains 46% of coarse material similar to the normalized concrete aggregates. The toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) highlighted the nonhazardous character of the studied gold waste rocks. The concentrations of leached pollutants were significantly lower than the limits fixed by the environmental protection agency (US-EPA). The same sample is classified as non-acid generating material. Considering the measured technological and environmental properties, concretes with good mechanical performances could be manufactured using gold mining waste rocks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Acid generation potential; Compressive strength; Concrete; Environmental behavior; Gold mining waste rocks","Aggregates; Chemical analysis; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Concretes; Construction industry; Environmental Protection Agency; Gold mines; Leaching; Minerals; Pollution; Recycling; Rocks; Sustainable development; Acid generation; Construction sectors; Environmental behavior; Environmental property; Gold mining; Mechanical performance; Sustainable management; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedures; Economic geology; aggregate; assessment method; concrete; gold mine; mining industry; recycling; solid waste; sustainability; waste management; Canada; Quebec [Canada]",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ( NSERC ).

At that time, there were six demolition contractors around Liverpool and they were using mobile crushers which were suited for road subbase material but not for the smaller sized aggregate required for precast concrete products. It was estimated that if all six worked round the clock, i.e. assuming there was enough feed material, they would still have found it difficult to maintain the required supplies for a single precast factory. Investment in equipment was therefore required to guarantee supply and improve the quality of the recycled demolition aggregate. The market forces and the incentives/drivers for construction companies to adopt sustainable practises have encouraged investment of several million pounds to be made in new recycling plants and this has resulted in ""urban quarries"". Work on reducing the carbon footprint of concrete construction needs to consider not only the replacement of the aggregate with recycled ones but also to consider a reduction or complete replacement of Portland cement in concrete mixes. Alkali activated binders and geopolymers have seen applications in ceramics, hazardous waste containment, fire-resistant construction materials and refractories but the most interesting application is their use to replace Portland cement-based concretes. Several factors affecting the reactivity of fly ash as a precursor for geopolymer concrete have been investigated. These include physical and chemical properties of various fly ash sources, inclusion of ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs), chemical activator dosages and curing temperature. Alkali-activated fly ash was found to require elevated curing temperatures and high alkali concentrations. A mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate was used and this was shown to result in high strengths, as high as 70 MPa at 28 days. The partial replacement of fly ash with ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) was found to be beneficial in not only avoiding the need for elevated curing temperatures but also in improving compressive strengths. It became apparent that the main obstacle to commercialisation of these new alternative binders was the cost of the activating solutions, i.e. the sodium hydroxide and the sodium silicate. The latter is the most expensive one and results in geopolymer concretes that cannot compete on price with Portland cement concretes. Attempts therefore concentrated on developing a procedure for the production of sodium hydroxide from waste streams, which in this case was ground glass cullet. Production of eco-friendly concretes thus becomes commercially possible. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aggregates; Binders; Blast furnaces; Carbon footprint; Compressive strength; Concrete construction; Concrete products; Construction industry; Curing; Demolition; Economics; Fly ash; Geopolymers; Inorganic polymers; Investments; Portland cement; Recycling; Silicates; Slags; Sodium hydroxide; Sustainable development; Alkali concentrations; Alkali-activated binder; Alkali-activated fly ashes; Construction companies; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Physical and chemical properties; Portland cement concretes; Recycled demolition aggregates; Precast concrete",,,,,"Veolia Environmental Trust; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 285463, FP7-2011-NMP ENV-ENERGY-ICT-EeB; Queen's University Belfast, QUB; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","The authors are grateful to the Veolia Environmental Trust, the Flintshire Community Trust Ltd (AD Waste Ltd) and the Northwest European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Programme for funding the several phases of some of the projects described.

Consequently, electronic wastes such as cathoderay tube (CRT) glass are accumulated, and hazardous wastes including heavy metals are generated. Simultaneously, natural resources are required to create concrete; however, they are already exhausted. Furthermore, heavyweight waste glass is considered to be the most suitable substitute for aggregate owing to its physical characteristics and chemical composition. However, structural results regarding the recycling of heavyweight waste glass as fine aggregate in Reinforced Concrete (RC) members are insufficient. Thus, herein, experimental study is conducted to evaluate whether RC members with heavyweight waste glass as fine aggregate can be applied for concrete structures. Flexural behavior tests of reinforced concrete members were performed. Fifteen specimens with different substitution ratios of heavyweight waste glass were prepared. The results showed that when all the fine aggregate is replaced by heavyweight waste glass in RC members, the heavyweight waste glass substitution ratio affected the crack occurrence patterns, and the possibility of a sudden failure of a member increased owing to concrete crushing in the compression zone. Additionally, the load capacity and flexural rigidity were affected by the substitution ratio of heavyweight waste glass; however, the flexural performance is improved when mineral admixture as a binder or a low water-binder ratio were used. Therefore, heavyweight waste glass is considered applicable for use as fine aggregate of concrete. © 2018 by the authors.","Cyclic load; Flexural behavior; Heavyweight waste glass; Recycling; Reinforced concrete member",,,,,,"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT","Funding: This research was supported by grant (18CTAP-C129756-02) from the Technology Advancement Research Program (TARP) funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government.",,,,,,,,,,"Choi, S.Y., Choi, Y.S., Yang, E.I., Characteristics of volume change and heavy metal leaching in mortar specimens recycled heavyweight waste glass as fine aggregate (2018) Constr.

Academic and industrial researches are currently focused on the possibility of recycling steel production residues in the cement industry, in order to produce new “low-carbon” binders for construction materials. The purpose of this paper is to assess the environmental benefits and costs of steel residue valorisation processes to produce a new binder for construction materials. Methods: Among other stainless steel slags (SSS), argon oxygen decarburisation (AOD)-slag has the potential to be recovered as a binder during the production of new construction materials. Alkali activation and carbonation processes can, in fact, activate the binding properties of the AOD-slag. However, AOD-slag is today only recycled as low-quality aggregate. For the present study, three different types of construction blocks (called SSS-blocks) were developed starting from the AOD-slag (one block through alkali activation and two blocks through carbonation). The data from the production of the three construction blocks have been collected and used to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) study, comparing SSS-block production with the production of traditional paver ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete. Results and discussion: The analysis showed that SSS-block production through alkali activation and carbonation has the potential of lowering some of the environmental impacts of OPC-concrete. The LCA results also show that the main bottleneck in the alkali activation process is the production of the alkali activators required in the process, while the use of electricity and of pure CO2 streams in carbonation lowers the environmental performances of the entire process. Conclusions: The valorisation of AOD-slag to produce new construction materials is a promising route to lower the environmental impacts of cement and concrete industries. This product-level analysis stresses the need of updating the LCI datasets for alkali activators and boric oxide and of widening the scope of the environmental analysis up to system level, including potential economic interactions and market exchanges between steel and construction sectors. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Alkali activation;

Using these binders, concrete brick samples containing LF were also made and examined for possible industrial applications. Although the influences of the LF addition on the strength, dissolution degree of the slag, reaction products, and pore-size distribution depended on the type and dosage of the activator, the addition was generally advantageous for all these aspects in both types of activations. The concrete brick made of 20 wt% LF using the Ba(OH)2 activation fulfilled the Korean standard requirements of strength and water absorption for concrete bricks, and it also satisfied the criteria of the leaching test for possible toxic elements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali activation; Ba(OH)2; Ca(OH)2; GGBFS; Limestone fines","Binders; Brick; Chemical activation; Concretes; Hydrated lime; Lime; Limestone; Pore size; Slags; Thermogravimetric analysis; Water absorption; Alkali activation; Concrete bricks; GGBFS; Limestone fines; Mercury intrusion porosimetry; Powder X ray diffraction; Standard requirements; Strength testing; Barium compounds",,,,,"NRF-2016R1D1A1B03932908; Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This study was supported by the Basic Science Research Programs (NRF-2016R1D1A1B03932908) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and also by NRF-2017-Global Ph.D. Fellowship Program, funded by the Ministry of Education , Republic of Korea.",,,,,,,,,,"Metha, K., Monteiro, P., Concrete: Microstructure, Properties, and Materials (2006), third ed.

The characteristics of new lightweight concrete mix are compared with standard concrete mix that contains natural gravel in terms of slump, density and compressive strength. The construction industry is one of the biggest sectors of the industry. It involves many fields such as the cement, additives and raw materials used in concrete mix as well as concrete products and insulating materials, etc. Thus, the cement industry can be considered a good scope for recycling the plastic wastes and getting rid from these wastes in a safe and clean way. In this research, two types of plastic wastes a polypropylene and polystyrene were investigated. These types of wastes are available in our live in massive amount. These wastes are considered a source of hazard to the health and environment. In addition, they are non-biodegradable and able to stay in the soil and survive for long periods. This can make these wastes a real threat to the environment because they contain highly dangerous toxins. Portland cement, natural coarse and fine aggregate are used in this research in addition to crushed wasted plastic. The preliminary tests such as sieve analysis, specific weight, density, absorption of natural aggregates were conducted. A reference mix free from light weight aggregate is designed according to the American method of concrete mixtures in simple steps. The water/cement ratio was equal (0.55) and compressive strength to (25 Mpa). Then, a part of natural coarse aggregates were replaced by light-weight aggregates in ratios between (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) for both plastics types used in this research. The water/cement ratio was kept stable for all mixes, the amount of absorbed water by the natural aggregates is calculated for each mixture. Then, different tests were conducted to the mixes. The slump test was conducted to fresh concrete then, the compressive strength and density were conducted for dry concrete Samples of tested cubes (dimensions 150 x150 x 150 mm). The density of a dry concrete test was done to the 1day-old of concrete cubes for the all concrete mixes. A compressive strength test was accomplished to the wet cubes with dry surfaces in ages (3, 7, 14 and 28) days. The results showed that the use of polypropylene gave an acceptable density and compressive strength results within the range of the compressive strength light weight concrete. However, it is difficult to work with concrete mixture that has a polyethylene because the mixture usually was non homogeneous properly. This caused a decrease in slump for concrete mixes.

Shredded tyre samples collected from a local recycling company in Melbourne were tested to evaluate any potential contaminant leaching from such material to the surrounding environment. Leaching tests were conducted for 100 potential contaminants following Australian Standard Leaching Procedure (ASLP) using three standard types of leaching solutions: acidic, neutral, and alkaline. From the series of leaching test results, it is clear that concentrations of all the assessed contaminants in the tested samples are either below their individual detection limits or below the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Victoria defined limits to label a material as hazardous. As such, in regards to leaching pollutants in the surrounding environment, tested crushed tyre samples are not hazardous and can be used for different engineering applications. Finally, a carbon footprint analysis was conducted considering a sustainable approach of using such crushed tyre with recycled concrete and recycled rock. It is found that through using such recycled materials carbon footprint savings per ton of road sub-base material would be 9.3 kg CO2e and 8.1 kg CO2e for using 2 and 3% tyre crumb, respectively. © 2018, University of Tehran.","Carbon footprint; Contaminants; Crushed concrete; Crushed rock; Crushed tyre","aggregate; carbon footprint; concentration (composition); concrete; leaching; recycling; sustainability; tire; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",,,,,"Riordan Foundation, TRF; Thailand Research Fund, TRF","Acknowledgements This research was supported under Tyre Stewardship Australia’s research project funding scheme.

Worn out tyres that are no longer safe to be used by vehicles are either discarded or burned, adversely impacting natural ecosystems. These wastes are non-degradable and have a direct environmental impact. Poor waste management can lead to hazardous pollution, reduced soil fertility, and increased space consumption at disposal sites. The massive and increasing volume of the tile and tyre wastes calls for recycling of the materials for economical reuse, cleaner production, and greener development. One area for beneficial reuse of these waste materials is the improvement of engineering properties in soft soil. Structures on soft soils may experience several forms of damage due to insufficient bearing capacity and excessive settlement. Hence, soil stabilization is often necessary to ensure that the soft soil can meet the engineering requirements for stability. A comprehensive review of the published literature on the use of recycled tyres and tiles to stabilize and enhance soft soils was carried out. The properties of soft soil-waste mixtures such as liquid limit, plastic limit, plasticity index, compaction behaviour, unconfined compressive strength, and California Bearing Ratio have been presented. When used as partial replacement of cement, sand, and aggregate in concrete, the effect of tyre and tile waste on workability, durability, and compressive strength of the concrete has also been presented. Recycled tiles and tyres have been used with or without any other admixtures to sustainably improve the strength and bearing capacity of soil. The suitability of recycled tiles and tyres in soil stabilization has been discussed with regard to enhancement of strength and reduction of settlement. In addition, the beneficial effects of the recycled tiles and tyres, when they partially replace cement, sand or stone in concrete, have been discussed. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","environmental pollution; recycled tiles; recycled tyre; soft soil; soil stabilization","Bearing capacity; Cements; Compressive strength; Concretes; Mechanical properties; Pollution control; Recycling; Soil mechanics; Soils; Tires; Waste disposal; Environmental pollutions; Recycled tiles; recycled tyre; Soft soils; Soil stabilization; Stabilization",,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: Q.J130000.2522.13H85; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM","The authors would like to thank the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for providing the Research University Grant Scheme (No.: Q.J130000.2522.13H85) in undertaking this research.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, A.C., Husin, N.I., Zainol, H., Tharim, A.H.A., Ismail, N.A., Ab Wahid, A.M., The construction solid waste minimization practices among malaysian contractors (2014) MATEC Web of Conferences, IDP Science, 7, pp. 1-9; Akbulut, S., Arasan, S., Kalkan, E., Modification of clayey soils using scrap tire rubber and synthetic fibers (2007) Applied Clay Science, 38 (2), pp. 23-32; Al Bakri, A.M.M., Norazian, M.N., Kamarudin, H., Razaidi, G.C.M., The potential of recycled ceramic waste as coarse aggregates for concrete (2008) Proc. of MUCET2008 Malaysian Universities Conferences on Engineering and Technology, Perlis, Malaysia, pp. 1-3; Al-Bared, M.A.M., Marto, A., A review on the geotechnical and engineering properties of marine clay and the suitable common stabilization methods (2017) Proc. of the second Int.

Brick dust is lavish material which on dumping not only occupy land but also it has environmental problems which is hazardous to livings. This waste is generated in brick kilns, brick masonry construction sites and during transportation. By recycling brick dust the problem could be solved up to some extent. In this research, brick dust was used in plain cement concrete to check its fresh and hardened properties. Brick dust was used to check the workability and strength of concrete, using the water-cement ratio of 0.55 which was kept constant during research. Three samples were cast for each 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days with 0%, 5%, 10% 15% and 20% incorporation of brick dust. The test results reveals that replacing cement with brick dust shows higher workability than control sample for 5%, 10% and 15%, of which 15% was greater of all. However, strength results were quite competitive, replacing cement with 15% brick dust shows higher compressive strength. The split tensile test were also conducted, which shows high tensile strength by replacing cement with 15% brick dust. This research shows that cement can be replaced with brick dust. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This study explores the feasibility of recycling PET solid wastes as short fibers in Strain-Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCCs), which exhibit strain-hardening and multiple cracking under tension, and therefore have clear advantages over conventional concrete for many construction applications. Based on micromechanical modeling, fiber dispersion and alkali resistance, the size of recycled PET fibers was first determined. Then the hydrophobic PET surface was treated with NaOH solution followed by a silane coupling agent to achieve the dual purpose of improving the fiber/matrix interfacial frictional bond (from 0.64 MPa to 0.80 MPa) and enhancing the alkali resistance for applications in alkaline cementitious environment. With surface treatment, recycling PET wastes as fibers in SHCCs is a promising approach to significantly reduce the material cost of SHCCs while disposing hazardous PET wastes in construction industry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fiber surface treatment; Micromechanical modeling; Polyethylene terephthalate; Solid wastes recycling; Strain-Hardening Cementitious Composite","Aliphatic compounds; Construction industry; Coupling agents; Fibers; Plastic bottles; Polyethylene terephthalates; Sodium hydroxide; Solid wastes; Strain hardening; Surface treatment; Construction applications; Conventional concrete; Fiber surface treatments; Micro-mechanical modeling; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Silane coupling agent; Solid wastes recycling; Strain-hardening cementitious composites; Plastic recycling; alkali; cement; concrete; maleic anhydride; methacrylic acid; polyethylene terephthalate; polypropylene; polyvinyl alcohol; silane; sodium hydroxide; cement (construction material); chemical method; composite; concrete; feasibility study; micromechanics; modeling; polymer; recycling; size; solid waste; Article; building industry; cement industry; chemical bond; chemical composition; chemical structure; dispersion; hazardous waste; hydrophobicity; industrial waste; recycling; solid waste management; surface property; tensile strength; Young modulus",,"maleic anhydride, 108-31-6; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; polyethylene terephthalate, 25038-59-9, 60527-88-0, 9003-68-3; polypropylene, 25085-53-4, 9003-07-0; polyvinyl alcohol, 37380-95-3, 9002-89-5; silane, 7803-62-5; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2",,,"CICR/11/13","This study was supported by the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council (Grant CICR/11/13 ).

Though the conventional concrete containing recycled plastics and polymer modifiers such as SBR latex has been explored up to an extent; the effects of blending of RPF and SBR latex on concrete is rarely explored. The objective was to evaluate the properties of concrete due to the addition of RPF and SBR latex blending and obtaining the optimum dosages of RPW and SBR latex. The tests for workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, impact strength, flexure strength, chloride ingress, acid and sulfate resistance and water sorptivity were carried out. The concrete was modified with the SBR latex dosage range of 0%–20% by weight of cement. The RPF was added in the range of 0%–2% by volume of the mix at the average length of the 20 mm and 0.4 mm diameter. The results exhibited improvement in fresh and hardened properties of modified concrete due to the combined addition of RPF and SBR latex namely improved cracking resistance, flexure resistance and reduced rate of chemical and water ingress into the specimens. The combination of 1% RPF by unit volume of concrete and 15% SBR latex by weight of cement showed improvement of all the properties of the concrete mixes. The study also demonstrated an effective way of preparing sustainable concrete from the hazardous plastic waste with enhanced properties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Compressive strength; Durability of concrete; Flexure strength; Impact strength; Recycled plastic fibers; Splitting tensile strength; Styrene-butadiene rubber latex; Workability","Acid resistance; Blending; Butadiene; Cements; Chlorine compounds; Compressive strength; Concretes; Cracking (chemical); Durability; Hardening; Impact strength; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Plastic recycling; Rubber; Styrene; Sulfur compounds; Tensile strength; Durability of concretes; Flexure strength; Recycled plastics; Splitting tensile strength; Styrene-butadiene rubber latex; Workability; Latexes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kardon, J.B., Polymer-modified concrete (1997) J.

Aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal in the world. During the production of aluminum, a huge amount of waste is produced, known as dross, which is used for recycling and re-extraction of remaining aluminum. The dross is found to be toxic and hazardous waste for the environment and hence recycling or locking up of this waste is very crucial. The dross is mainly composed of oxides and aluminum and in the recycling, salt process is employed to recycle aluminum from the dross. This paper examines various forms of production of aluminum scrap, treatment methods, and typical application of aluminum residue. Brief description on waste management aspects is provided in this paper. The important observations made from the review studies are summarized. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Aluminum waste; re-use; recycle; sustainability; treatment methods","Aluminum; Concrete products; Locks (fasteners); Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Sustainable development; Aluminum scraps; Aluminum waste; Cement and concretes; Hazardous wastes; Re-extraction; Re-utilization; Treatment methods; Typical application; Waste treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Siliceous by-products for use in concrete (1988) Mater.

It is typically discarded with minimal reuse or recycling. As landfill wood disposal could result in methane emissions and/or leaching of hazardous constituents polluting water or soil, the implementation of temporary wood waste reduction strategies must be a critical issue for local construction companies. To manage and control wood waste generation, including setting some reduction goals, it is necessary to identify the influencing factors and ways to quantitatively predict their relative contributions. This study uses a multiple regression statistical model to estimate the amount of temporary wood waste generated in the construction of high-rise buildings by considering the influencing factors related to the design/construction as well as site and safety installations. The case study includes 22 high-rise residential buildings. The regression model predicted approximately 89% of the factors involved in the generation of wood waste in similar constructions. The dependent variables that had an influence on the amount of wood waste are related to design features (‘number of floors’), structural construction system (‘in situ moulded concrete volume’), and site and safety installations (‘site wood fence’ and ‘wood use rate’). Ways of minimising wood waste generation and the contributions of each type of temporary wood use were discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Civil construction; Temporary wood waste; Wood waste quantitative measurements","Construction industry; Regression analysis; Structural design; Tall buildings; Waste disposal; Water pollution; Wood; Wooden floors; Civil constructions; Construction companies; High rise residential building; High-rise building constructions; Quantitative measurement; Relative contribution; Safety installations; Statistical modeling; Wooden construction; building construction; multistorey building; quantitative analysis; recycling; waste management; wood; analytical parameters; Article; case study; physical parameters; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; safety; solid waste; solid waste management; statistical model; statistical parameters; wood; article; dependent variable; multiple regression; quantitative analysis; Brazil",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa) and to all the construction firms for providing information, documents, and access to the construction sites.",,,,,,,,,,"Bania, G.S., Achillas, C., Vlachokosta, C., Moussiopoulos, N., Papaioannou, I., A web-based Decision Support System for the optimal management of construction and demolition waste (2011) Waste Manage.

The inherent inferior quality of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) makes the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) beams even more vulnerable in shear resistance. This persuades the structural designers to account each of the contributing components in the shear resistance mechanisms seriously, especially that of concrete. In this regard, an experimental investigation was carried out on fourteen beams to examine the shear performance of RAC beams in the absence and presence of transverse reinforcement. Six numbers of beams without transverse reinforcement were tested to examine the contribution of RAC in shear resistance mechanisms and eight beams with shear reinforcement were tested to verify the applicability of the prevailing shear design provisions for RAC beams. The inferior mechanical properties of the RAC are improved satisfactorily by implementing the Particle Packing Method of mix design approach along with the established Two Stage Mixing Approach. However, even with the improved mechanical properties of RAC, the poor performance of RAC beams in shear could not be avoided and a drop of 14% was recorded in the ultimate shear strength of RAC beams without stirrups. A database is prepared by compiling the reported test results of RAC beams with and without transverse reinforcement. An alternative equation is proposed to predict the diagonal tension cracking strength of RAC beams, by using the database of RAC beams without transverse reinforcement and it exhibits a better correlation with the experimental results. Further, in the shear resistance mechanisms of RAC beams the effectiveness of stirrups is studied using the database of RAC beams without and with transverse reinforcement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Particle packing method; Recycled aggregate concrete; Reinforced concrete beams; Shear behaviour; Shear strength prediction","Aggregates; Bridge decks; Concrete aggregates; Concrete beams and girders; Database systems; Design; Mechanical properties; Recycling; Shear strength; Particle packings; Recycled aggregate concrete; Reinforced concrete beams; Shear behaviour; Shear strength predictions; Reinforced concrete",,,,,"Ministry of Human Resource Development, MHRD","First author gratefully acknowledges the financial support provided for the project on “Sustainable and Cost Effective Housing using Recycled Aggregate Based Concrete” under the mega project on Future of Cities by MHRD , Government of India.

Two major issues within environmental sustainability were addressed: concrete waste reuse rate and mitigation of hazards substances in the polluted air. The study consisted of two stages: identification of proper replacement rates of recycled concrete wastes in new concrete mixture design, and the evaluation of photocatalytic performance of recycled aggregate concrete in degrading NO2. It was found that replacement rates up to 3%, 30%, and 50% for recycled power, recycled fine aggregate, and recycled coarse aggregate respectively could be applied in concrete mixture design without deteriorating concrete strength. Recycled aggregates contained both positive attributes (“internal curing”) and negative effects (e.g., lower hardness) to concrete properties. It was found that 30%–50% of natural coarse aggregate replaced by recycled coarse aggregates coated with TiO2 would significantly improve the photocatalytic performance of concrete measured by degradation rate of NO2. Micro-structures of recycled aggregates observed under microscope indicated that soaking recycled aggregates in TiO2 solution resulted in whiskers that filled the porosity within recycled aggregates which enhanced concrete strength. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Concrete mixture design; Concrete waste; Environmental sustainability; Photocatalyst; Recycled aggregate concrete","Aggregates; Air cleaners; Concrete mixtures; Degradation; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Photocatalysts; Recycling; Sustainable development; Titanium dioxide; Concrete mixture designs; Concrete wastes; Environmental sustainability; Experimental investigations; Photocatalytic performance; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled coarse aggregate; Recycled fine aggregates; Concrete aggregates; concrete; nitric oxide; titanium dioxide; aggregate; catalysis; catalyst; concrete; experimental study; hazardous waste; photochemistry; purification; recycling; sustainability; air pollution control; air purification; Article; environmental sustainability; model; photocatalysis; photodegradation; porosity; purification; recycling; waste",,"nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0",,,"2012C50047; Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo: 2015A610297; University of Brighton; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51778577; Ningbo Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology: 2015C50049; National Science and Technology Planning Project: 2015BAL02B03","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of National Science and Technology Support Program of China (Grant No. 2015BAL02B03 ), Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo (Grant No. 2015A610297 ), Ningbo Social Development Project (Grant No. 2012C50047 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Contract No. 51778577), and Ningbo the Benefit of People Program from the Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau (Contract No. 2015C50049).

This paper includes an experimental investigation to find the ability of producing fiber reinforced concrete by adding used syringe needles to concrete. The effect of adding syringe needles to concrete mixture on its physical and mechanical properties has been studied. The properties of concrete with syringe needles have been compared with plain concrete and the one with industrial steel fibers. Concrete properties have been effected as syringe needles have been added to the mixture. Concrete tensile and flexural strength have increased by 1.47% and 0.95 % respectively, while the compressive strength and density have decreased by 2.85% and 1.52 % respectively. Adding industrial steel fibers to concrete have increased its tensile strength, its flexural strength, its compressive strength and its density by 7.28 %, 6.25%, 3.93 % and 1.25% respectively. The recorded slump results for the three mixtures showed that the needle fibers mix. has been the most stiff one by 5.2 cm of slump, while the steel fibers mix slump has been 7.3 cm.

Replacement rates of 40% developed a lower strength (30 and 33.5öMPa), but were still suitable for applications. The pulverized fuel ash perform substantially worse. We conclude that the biomass fly ash from fluidized bed combustion performs as a functional secondary cementitious material in cement, whereas the functionality of pulverized fuel fly ash is insufficient. The release of environmentally relevant elements from all the tested specimens fulfilled the Dutch leaching criteria for reuse. During second life as a granular construction material the release of Ba, Cr, Mo and V increased to a level of concern. However, this release was found to be similar to that of existing blended cements and was controlled by cement chemistry. The technical performance of cement mortars was influenced by the type and ratio of fly ash mixed with cement. However, the environmental performance was driven by the cement matrix that controlled the release of contaminants. Using biomass fly ash as a secondary cementitious material can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by 40% while maintaining good technical and environmental performance. © 2018 The Author(s)","Biomass ash; Blended cement; Compressive strength; Leaching; Secondary cementitious material","Biomass; Carbon footprint; Cements; Combustion; Compressive strength; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fluidized bed combustion; Fly ash; Leaching; Mortar; Portland cement; Pulverized fuel; Biomass ashes; Blended cement; Cementitious materials; Environmental performance; Environmental property; Granular construction; Pulverized fuel ashes; Technical performance; Strength of materials; barium; biofuel; carbon; cement; cement mortar; chromium; concrete; molybdenum; unclassified drug; vanadium; biomass; carbon footprint; cement (construction material); compressive strength; fly ash; leaching; mortar; performance assessment; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; chemical composition; combustion; compressive strength; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental release; fluidized bed; fly ash; hazardous waste; leaching; life cycle assessment; pH; recycling; wood ash",,"barium, 7440-39-3; carbon, 7440-44-0; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; molybdenum, 7439-98-7; vanadium, 7440-62-2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Berra, M., Casa, G.D., Dell'Orso, M., Galeotti, L., Mangialardi, T., Paolini, A.E., Piga, L., Reuse of woody biomass fly ash in cement-based materials: leaching tests (2011) Recycling of Biomass Ashes, , H.

The subject of this study is a municipal solid waste landfill located in southwestern Poland and its related facilities included in the technological processes of waste disposal, treatment, and recycling. The paper briefly discusses the construction process stage and the first stage of operation of the studied facility in respect of their future impact on the environment. At the present time, waste is used to obtain landfill gas for electricity generation and materials to be reincorporated or disposed of, i.e. construction debris (brick, concrete), structural steel, firewood, and plastics. The range of topics presented in the paper is in accord with the sustainable development tendency and the paper specifically focuses on potential hazards arising from presence and operation of facilities of this type (built at a time when environment protection regulations were less restrictive as to their location). Continuity and effectiveness of insulation membranes of landfills are important inasmuch as once such landfills are filled with waste and then closed and reclaimed at the final stage, it will be extremely difficult to identify sites of potential leaks of basins, whose expected lifespan is several decades or a few hundred years. If such leaks are found within this period, it will be necessary to remove reclamation layers and strongly thickened waste in order to reach them [12]. Then, new damage resulting from operation of heavy equipment might occur. Therefore, apart from standard protection solutions of landfills, additional warning systems should be applied for maximum elimination of environmental pollution hazards, the range of which can be supralocal or even supraregional. Such systems should precisely indicate the location of probable places of hazards. It is not about damage to facilities, including cells, but about safety of their surroundings. Due to the vastness of the topic referred to herein, the paper has been narrowed down to include only one issue, i.e. tightness of cells intended for non-hazardous and non-inert waste. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Building materials; Electric power generation; Hazards; Municipal solid waste; Reservoirs (water); Stages; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Construction debris; Construction process; Electricity generation; Environment protection; Environmental pollutions; Impact on the environment; Municipal solid waste landfills; Technological process; Land fill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rozporządzenie Ministra Środowiska z dnia 30 kwietnia 2013 r. w sprawie składowisk odpadów; Ustawa z dnia 7 lipca 1994 roku Prawo budowlane z późn. zmianami; Bilitewski, B., Hardtle, G., Klaus, M., (2006) Podrȩcznik Gospodarki Odpadami, Teoria i Praktyka, p. 200. , Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Seidel-Przywecki Sp; Korzeniowska-Rejmer, E., (2003) Rola Geotechniki W Zapewnieniu Bezpiecznego Składowania Odpadów Komunalnych, pp. 159-168. , Czasopismo Techniczne, z. 1-Ś/2003, Wydawnictwo Politechniki Krakowskiej, Kraków; Zygadło, M., (1998) Gospodarka Odpadami Komunalnymi, , Kielce; Stȩpniak, S., Rozwiązania geotechniczne chroniące wody gruntowe pod wysypiskami (1994) Gospodarka Wodna, 12, pp. 286-288; Carbofol, Huls Troisdorf AG-materiały Ofertowe Firmy; Koc-Jurczyk, J., Treatment technologies of municipal waste landfill leachates (2009) Sewages and Waste Materials in Environment, pp. 59-71; Davis, J.S., Energy Limits to Technical Recycling, , Conf.

The methodology was carried out in three stages. The first was to map the illegal construction and demolition of waste disposal points across Recife and classify the waste according to its recyclability. In sequence, a method for indicating suitable areas for installation of voluntary delivery points, for small waste generators, are presented. Finally, a method for indicating suitable areas for the installation of trans-shipment and waste sorting areas, developed for large generators, is presented. The results show that a geographic information system is an essential tool in the planning of municipal construction and demolition waste management, in order to facilitate the spatial analysis and control the generation, sorting, collection, transportation, and final destination of construction and demolition waste, increasing the rate of recovery and recycling of materials. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Construction and demolition waste; decision support system; management; spatial analysis","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Demolition; Geographic information systems; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Management; Materials handling; Spatial variables measurement; Construction and demolition; Construction and demolition waste; Large generator; Municipal managements; Planning systems; Recycling of materials; Spatial analysis; Waste generators; Waste disposal; concrete; plastic; construction industry; demolition; GIS; recycling; spatial analysis; waste disposal; waste management; Article; ceramics; construction work; decision support system; environmental impact; geographic information system; global positioning system; hazardous waste site; kernel method; priority journal; recycling; sewage; solid waste management; spatial analysis; urban area; waste disposal; waste management; wood; Brazil; building material; Brazil; Pernambuco; Recife; Brazil; Construction Materials; Geographic Information Systems; Recycling; Waste Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NBR 15,112, de 30 de junho de 2004 (2004) Resíduos da construção civil e resíduos volumosos, áreas de transbordo e triagem: Diretrizes para projeto, implantação e operação, , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, [in Portuguese]; Ajayi, S.O., Oyedele, L.O., Bilal, M., Critical management practices influencing on-site waste minimization in construction projects (2017) Waste Management, 59, pp. 330-339; Banias, G., Achillas, C., Vlachokostas, C., A web-based decision support system for the optimal management of construction and demolition waste (2011) Waste Management, 31, pp. 2497-2502; Resolução nº 307, de 5 de Julho de 2002 (2002) Estabelece diretizes, critérios e procedimentos para a gestão dos resíduos da construção civil, , Brasília, Brazil, Diário Oficial da República Federativa do Brasil [in Portuguese]; Córdoba, R.E., (2010) Estudo do sistema de gerenciamento integrado de resíduos da construção e demolição do município de São Carlos, , Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, [, ].

One result of economic growth is an increase in generation of solid waste which normally was dumped in landfills and caused contamination of soil, water and air from toxic substances such as polychlorinated bi-phenyls (PCB's), asbestos, construction chemicals, heavy metals, but the scarcity of land-filling areas, industrial growth as well as strict environmental regulations in developed and developing economies has led to the global re-assessment of the methods employed to recycle and utilise construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste as recycled aggregate for civil engineering projects i.e. construction and infrastructure development. Depending on their quality, recycled aggregate produced from C&amp;D waste can be employed in various civil engineering works, which can help in a long way the economic and environmental sustainability of respective countries. With further research and development into overcoming technical as well as market barriers, considerable increase in recovery rates can be achieved with the existing technologies in developed economies. The main aim of this study is to review the literature on the production and utilisation of recycled aggregate in concrete, concrete pavements, roadway construction, and other civil engineering works and some discussion on the savings on CO2 emissions have been included. The globally published data on recycled aggregate standards (normative documents) of various countries have been systematically analysed and evaluated, and some barriers mentioned. This review may help to alleviate the concerns of consumers and encourage and further promote the use of recycled aggregate on a larger scale in civil engineering projects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Construction and demolition waste; International norms; Legislation; Recycled aggregate","Aggregates; Concretes; Demolition; Environmental regulations; Heavy metals; Industrial chemicals; Land fill; Laws and legislation; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Recycling; Soil pollution; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Civil engineering projects; Construction and demolition; Construction and demolition waste; Environmental sustainability; Infrastructure development; International norms; Recycled aggregates; Research and development; Industrial economics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Slattery, K., Global developments in the aggregate industry: global aggregates information (2016) Network; (2012), p. 1. , The Freedonia Group.

Furthermore, recycling waste consumes energy and produces pollution. In addition, accumulation of waste in the suburbs and the disposal of waste are very dangerous for the environment. Using waste material in concrete production is an appropriate method for achieving two goals: eliminating waste and adding positive properties in concrete. Since the green concrete industry is expanding, it is necessary to evaluate concrete that contains waste from all aspects in order to determine its capability. This literature study consists of two parts i.e. the use of waste as a substitute for cement and as a substitute for aggregates. Leading waste material that has been used as substitutes is highlighted and the characteristics of the resulting concrete is evaluated. Among other findings, rubber was found to have improved fire resistance and ductility in concrete and agricultural and PET wastes were successfully used in non-structural concrete, while glass helped to improve thermal stability. © 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Concrete;

The concrete mixtures were prepared using 10, 20, 30, 40, 50% of E-waste plastic [high impact polystyrene (HIPS)] as a partial replacement per unit volume of coarse aggregate. The compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and surface hardness of concrete specimens were examined before and after the thermal exposure. The concrete cube specimens with HIPS were heated to 100, 200, and 300°C for 1 h using muffle furnace. The compressive strength of specimens at room temperature was decreased with an increase of HIPS content. However, the specimens retained the compressive strength of about 50 at 50% HIPS replacement. Similarly, the compressive strength of specimens subjected to elevated temperatures after thermal shock decreased with an increase of HIPS and temperature. The nondestructive tests were carried out using a rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse velocity test. The rebound hammer results provides very consistent results similar to experimental values. Regardless the temperature, concrete incorporated upto 25% HIPS showed an ultrasonic pulse velocity within the limiting value 3,000 m/s. This study shows the feasiblility of using E-waste plastic (HIPS) in concrete as construction material in order to reduce the environmental pollution and conserve the natural resource from depletion. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Coarse aggregate; Concrete; Electronic waste (E-waste); High-impact polystyrene (HIPS); Temperature; Thermal shock","Aggregates; Compressive strength; Concrete mixtures; Concretes; Conservation; Electronic Waste; Hammers; Light velocity; Nondestructive examination; Plastic recycling; Polystyrenes; Temperature; Thermal shock; Ultrasonic testing; Wastes; Coarse aggregates; Electronic waste (e waste); Environmental pollutions; Experimental investigations; High impact polystyrene; Physical and mechanical properties; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; Ultrasonic pulse velocity tests; Electronic equipment; aggregate; concrete; electronic waste; hazardous waste; mechanical property; physical property; plastic waste; polymer; temperature effect",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arjun, R.K., Senthil Kumar, K., Effect of recycled PVC fibers from electronic waste and silica powder on shear strength of concrete (2017) J.

The presence of leachable salts like NaCl and KCl in aluminum dross aggravates the environmental crisis, whereas the metallic aluminum entrapped in the matrix of alumina can be used as raw material for metal extraction. Pyrometallurgical methods, like rotary salt furnaces and salt-free technologies, are industrially applied for recovery of aluminum. Many hydrometallurgical technologies have been patented that consume aluminum dross to produce aluminum alum and other industrially applicable products. Newer applications of aluminum dross include its direct utilization in the production of zeolites, ion exchangers, refractories, composites, cement and concrete products and generation of gases like hydrogen, ammonia, methane. This review paper discusses the generation of aluminum dross, its environmental impacts, the industrial methods for recovery of metal from it and recent developments in its utilization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum dross; Hydrogen; Hydrometallurgical treatment; Pyrometallurgical treatment; Utilization","Alumina; Aluminous refractories; Aluminum metallurgy; Chlorine compounds; Concrete products; Environmental impact; Hydrogen; Hydrometallurgy; Industrial plants; Ion exchangers; Metal recovery; Pyrometallurgy; Recovery; Smelting; Sodium compounds; Waste utilization; Aluminum dross; Cement and concretes; Environmental crisis; Hydrometallurgical technology; Hydrometallurgical treatments; Industrial methods; Metallic aluminum; Pyrometallurgical treatments; Aluminum; aluminum; aluminum oxide; aluminum potassium sulfate; ammonia; cement; concrete; hydrogen; potassium chloride; sodium chloride; zeolite; aluminum; extraction method; hydrogen; metallurgy; waste treatment; environmental impact; industrial waste; metal extraction; metal industry; metallurgy; recycling; Review",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; aluminum potassium sulfate, 10043-67-1; ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; potassium chloride, 7447-40-7; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ünlü, N., Drouet, M.G., Comparison of salt-free aluminum dross treatment processes (2002) Resour.

These materials are highly versatile; hence, some of their aspects, such as their interaction with toxic materials, should be examined in greater depth. An investigation was therefore undertaken to ascertain how these products react to phorbol ester (PE), a toxin found in Jatropha seed cake (JSC). The mechanical behavior of mortar and concrete containing JSC waste from the manufacture of biofuel was examined based on the analysis of axial compressive strength. The interaction between mortar and PE molecules was examined by means of high performance liquid chromatography. A study of the mechanical behavior of the materials indicated that the inclusion of JSC greatly reduced their mechanical properties, and that this inclusion had a stronger impact on mortar than on concrete, while liquid chromatography showed that the toxic material inserted into the mortar remained inert, indicating the promising potential of this material to store toxic products.","Concrete; Sustainability; Toxic material recycling","Chromatography; Compressive strength; Concrete products; Concretes; High performance liquid chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mortar; Sustainable development; Axial compressive strength; Civil construction materials; Jatropha seed cakes; Material recycling; Mechanical behavior; Phorbol esters; Toxic products; Toxic materials; Civil Engineering; Compression Strength; Concrete; Esters; Liquid Chromatography; Mortar",,,,,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Universidade Estadual Paulista, UNESP","The authors gratefully acknowledge Brazil’s Federal Agency for the Support (CAPES) and Improvement of Higher Education, and São Paulo State University (UNESP) for their financial support of this work.",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) 'Standard test method for compressive strength of cylindrical concrete specimens,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2015) 'Standard test method for relative density (specific gravity) and absorption of coarse aggregate,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2015) 'Standard test method for relative density (specific gravity) and absorption of fine aggregate,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2016) 'Standard practice for making and curing concrete test specimens in the laboratory,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2014) 'Standard test method for flexural strength of hydraulic-cement mortars,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2016) 'Standard specification for mortar cement,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2014) 'Standard Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry1,', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; (2016) 'Standard test method for particle-size analysis of soils (Withdrawn 2016),', , ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA; Cass, Q.B., Degani, A.L.G., 'Desenvolvimento de métodos por HPLC: Fundamentos, estratégias e validação série apontamentos,' (2011) In: Validação de Métodos Analíticos, 2011, p. 77. , [Validation of Analytical Methods], São Carlos (São Paulo, Brazil): EdUFSCar; Devappa, R.K., Makkar, H.P., Becker, K., 'Localization of antinutrients and qualitative identification of toxic components in Jatropha curcas seed,' (2011) Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 92 (7), pp. 1519-1525; Faber, K., Kowalski, B.R., 'Net analyte signal calculation in multivariate calibration,' (1997) Analytical Chemistry, 69, pp. 1620-1626; Lee, H.V., Yunus, R., Juan, J.C., Taufiq-yap, Y.H., 'Process optimization design for Jatropha-based biodiesel production using response surface methodology,' (2011) Fuel Process Technology, 92 (12), pp. 2420-2428; Iqbal, M., Quiasrawi, H., 'Closed-loop recycling of recycled concrete aggregates,' (2012) Journal of Cleaner Production, 37, pp. 243-248; Martins, M.L., Primel, E.G., Caldas, S.S., Prestes, O.D., Adaime, M.B., Zanella, R., 'Microextração líquido-líquido dispersiva (DLLME) fundamentos e aplicações,' (2012) Scientia Chromatographica, 4 (1), pp. 35-51; Roque, J.V., Dias, L.A.S., Teofilo, R.F., 'Multivariate calibration to determine phorbol esters in seeds of Jatropha curcas L. using near infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopies,' (2017) Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society, 28 (8), pp. 1506-1516; Souza, C.A.C., Machado, A.T., Lima, L.R.P.A., Cardoso, R.J.C., 'Stabilization of electric-arc furnace dust in concrete,' (2010) Materials Research, 13 (4), pp. 513-519","Santana, M.; Department of Civil Engineering, Brazil; email: marcelosantana92@gmail.com",,,"North Carolina State University",,,,,19302126,,,,"English","BioResour.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041310244

Potential beneficial applications for concrete grinding residue include use as a soil amendment and as a construction material, including as an additive to Portland cement concrete. Concrete grinding residue exhibits a high pH, and though not hazardous, it is sufficiently elevated that precautions need to be taken around aquatic ecosystems. Best management practices and state regulations focus on reducing the impact on such aquatic environment. Heavy metals are present in concrete grinding residue, but concentrations are of the same magnitude as typically recycled concrete residuals. The chemical composition of concrete grinding residue makes it a useful product for some soil amendment purposes at appropriate land application rates. The presence of unreacted concrete in concrete grinding residue was examined for potential use as partial replacement of cement in new concrete. Testing of Florida concrete grinding residue revealed no dramatic reactivity or improvement in mortar strength. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","beneficial use; CGR management; Concrete; grinding residue; mortar","Aquatic ecosystems; Concretes; Grinding (machining); Heavy metals; Laws and legislation; Mortar; Portland cement; Soil cement; Soils; Aquatic environments; Beneficial use; Best management practices; Chemical compositions; Land applications; Partial replacement; Portland cement concretes; Recycled concretes; Concrete testing; aluminum; arsenic; barium; beryllium; boron; cadmium; calcium; calcium hydroxide; calcium silicate; chromium; cobalt; concrete; copper; magnesium oxide; manganese; molybdenum; nickel; potassium; sodium; trace metal; heavy metal; chemical composition; concrete; grinding; heavy metal; mortar; soil amendment; waste management; agricultural slurry; alkalinity; Article; atomic emission spectrometry; Bromus inermis; Florida; hydraulic conductivity; isothermal titration calorimetry; pH; priority journal; soil amendment; waste management; X ray diffraction; building material; recycling; soil; Construction Materials; Florida; Metals, Heavy; Recycling; Soil",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; arsenic, 7440-38-2; barium, 7440-39-3; beryllium, 7440-41-7; boron, 7440-42-8; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; calcium hydroxide, 1305-62-0; calcium silicate, 1344-95-2, 13983-17-0; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; cobalt, 7440-48-4; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; magnesium oxide, 1309-48-4, 1317-74-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; molybdenum, 7439-98-7; nickel, 7440-02-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; Metals, Heavy; Soil",,,"Florida Department of Transportation","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Florida Department of Transportation (Tim Ruelke: Project Manager), in conjunction with the Hinkley Center for Solid and Hazardous Waste Management in Gainesville, Florida.",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Standard Specification for Portland Cement, , West Conshohocken, PA, ASTM International; Amin, A.F.M.S., Hasnat, A., Khan, A.H., Residual cementing property in recycled fines and coarse aggregates: Occurrence and quantification (2016) Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 28; Berger, R.L., Carpenter, S.H., (1981) Recycling of concrete into new applications, pp. 325-339. , Adhesion Problems in the Recycling of Concrete.

Unlike the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, metalized plastic wastes (MPW) produced by discarded food packaging articles are not suitable for recycling and reuse owing to the metalized layer. MPW litter in waste streams or sent to the landfill as a part of municipal solid waste (MSW) resulting in hazardous environmental impacts. Efforts are made in this work to utilize MPW in concrete as a sustainable usage of the specific waste. In present work, MPW is shredded into fibers of varying sizes and added to concrete ranging 0% to 2% by volume of concrete. The response of addition of MPW in concrete was evaluated by assessing workability and strength properties namely slump, compaction factor, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and flexure strength. The results show significantly improved crack resistance and ductility in concrete reinforced with MPW. The increase in tensile resistance of concrete containing MPW up to 1% of volume fraction was observed. Flexure test results exhibited improved ductility of concrete containing MPW. However, reduction in the fresh properties and compressive and flexure strength of concrete was noticed with the increased fraction of MPW beyond 1% dosage. The experimental study establishes the potential of the sustainable use of MPW in concrete to reduce adverse environmental impacts and to improve the tensile resistance of the conventional concrete. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Compressive strength; Concrete; Metalized plastic waste; Splitting tensile strength; Workability","Aliphatic compounds; Compressive strength; Ductility; Metallizing; Metals; Municipal solid waste; Packaging machines; Plastic bottles; Polyethylene terephthalates; Polypropylenes; Sustainable development; Tensile strength; Adverse environmental impacts; Concrete reinforced; Conventional concrete; Feasibility studies; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); Splitting tensile strength; Surface metallization; Concretes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An Analysis of European Plastics Production (2015) Demand and Waste Data, , A report by plastics Europe, Association of plastic manufacturers. www. plasticseurope.org; It’s Uses, Benefits and Waste Management Options (1997) A Report Prepared by Headly Pratt Consulting for American Plastic Council; Rahmani, E., Dehestani, M., Beygi, M.H.A., Allahyari, H., Nikbin, I.M., On the mechanical properties of concrete containing waste PET particles (2013) Constr.

Extensive amounts of building materials required for construction of roads facilitates the use of recycled old surfaces from the ecological and economical point of view. Reconstruction and development of new roads requires acquisition and processing of different materials such as: soils, aggregates acquired from unbound layers, concrete and asphalt surfaces, and particularly hazardous surfaces with tar bonding agent. After proper processing the materials can be enhanced, resulting in a full-value building material for road construction. In Poland, due to increased number of carried out national and secondary road investments, recycled aggregates are extremely topical issue. The increased demand for various construction materials caused by the investments has a negative effect on the surrounding environment. Increased demand results in increased prices of construction materials. Therefore, it is important to utilize recycled materials. The publication presents various methods of processing old surfaces, available technologies and specification of processed materials. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

In the case of recycled aggregate from concrete structures is the best way crushed the material and sorted into individual fractions, which can be used as a substitute for natural (virgin) aggregate. This way of application does not bring significant financial gain, but has a huge environmental benefit. Recycled aggregate should meet standards for concrete aggregates.

Some of the studies were dedicated to recycling hazardous waste in a manner that is safe and protective of human health and the environment. The aim of this work is to study the possibility of using clinical waste as the aggregates for manufacturing construction materials. For that purpose, firstly a technology of initial sterilization with combustion of clinical waste was considered. Secondly as along as the clinical waste became sterile and environmentally safe, nonhazardous fractionated products of clinical waste combustion were proposed as aggregate for concretes. This study reports the results of the experiment when different concrete compositions with such aggregate were obtained, investigated and tested using samples (100 mm cubes). Physicchemical properties of the material were described; its environmental impact was assessed. Thirdly, the potential of the big city in clinical waste generation and subsequent use of fractionated products of clinical waste combustion in construction materials manufacturing was evaluated. As a result of the use of ArcGIS ESRI geoinformation system, a visual representation of the information has been provided. The results of this study show the possibility of using non-hazardous clinical wastes combustion products in manufacturing construction materials and also in road construction. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Clinical waste; Concrete recycled aggregate; Construction materials; Environment; GIS-technologies; Sustainable development; Thermal disinfection","Aggregates; Building materials; Concrete aggregates; Environmental impact; Geographic information systems; Hazards; Recycling; Sustainable development; Clinical waste; Environment; GIS technology; Manufacturing construction; Materials manufacturing; Physic-chemical properties; Recycled aggregates; Visual representations; Waste incineration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borisenko, L.F., Delitsyn, L.M., Vlasov, A.S., (2001) Perspectives of Using Ash from Coal Thermal Power Plants, , ZAO Geoinformmark, Moscow; Tselikovsky, Y.K., Experience of industrial use of ash and slag wastes of thermal power plants.

It includes a breakdown of waste tonnage according to the origin of the waste, how it was managed and how it was classified under the 2008 Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). This findings from the survey, together with those of previous Concawe waste surveys for 1993 (Concawe; 1-95) and 1986 (Concawe; 5-89), show how the sector has responded to developments in EU waste legislation over the past 30 years. In addition, the data constitute a modern baseline for the future assessment of performance. Total waste production reported by the refining sector in 2013 was 1.2 million tonnes, of which 43% was classified as hazardous. The top 3 reported hazardous wastes types by tonnage are sludges (comprising tank bottoms, physical/chemical treatment, biological treatment and other), followed by spent chemicals/acids/bases and then contaminated soil/stones/aggregate/concrete (with approximately one third of these arising from remediation activities). The top 3 non-hazardous wastes comprise soils/stones/aggregate/concrete, followed by metal and biological wastewater treatment sludges. Soils/stones/aggregate/concrete constitute 65% of the total non-hazardous waste reported, while metal and biological wastewater treatment sludges constitute 9% and 4%, respectively. The vast majority (94%) of refinery wastes were disposed within the country of origin, with only spent catalyst exported outside the EU (to specialist recovery facilities). Recycling accounted for the largest waste tonnage (34%), followed by waste going to landfill (20%). This is in contrast to the 1993 survey, which found that landfill accounted for 40% and recycling 21%. In parallel, the percentage of waste used for energy recovery reduced from 15% in 1993 to 7% in 2013, while the percentage of waste disposed of by incineration reduced slightly from 8% to 6%. These findings demonstrate that the sector has been successful in moving waste streams up the EU waste hierarchy, with an increasing proportion of waste going to recovery, recycling and re-use. Legislative changes and associated changes in waste reporting practices mean that the 1993 and 2013 data on refinery waste tonnage and handling costs are not directly comparable. For example, the apparent increase in total waste tonnage from 1993 to 2013 may well reflect more systematic waste classification and reporting under the 2008 Waste Framework Directive. The total cost of refinery waste management appears to have significantly increased, from an inflation-Adjusted figure of approximately 80 M$ in 1986 (for 89 refineries), to 137.2 M$ in 2013 (for 74 refineries).","European refinery waste; Inventory; Waste; Waste classification codes; Waste framework directive; Waste handling costs; Waste hazard codes; Waste management options; Waste production; Waste survey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1995) Oil Refinery Waste Disposal Routes, Quantities and Costs 1993 Survey, , Concawe.

The process to obtain iron ore concentrates from BIFs generates huge amounts of tailings. About half of the extracted volume is transformed into tailings, which are usually employed to fill exhausted open pits or stored in dams. Although these tailings are inert and non-hazardous, the huge volumes cause concerns related to safety of dams. With the shortage of space for dams and increasing costs of monitoring and licensing, the use of tailings as raw material for other manufacturing chains is becoming attractive. A synthetic gravel for concrete production was obtained with the sandy residue from BIFs exploitation and recycled polyehtyltherephatalate (PET). The process to obtain the synthetic gravel, its properties, as well as the properties of concrete is presented. The unitary mass of this gravel is 0,89 kg/dm3 (lightweight aggregate). The compressive resistance of the concrete after 7 days was around 9 MPa, the water absorption was 13.6–14.9%, and the density of the concrete was about 1.9 g/cm3. The concrete is suitable for making light bricks for masonry in the region of the mines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Banded iron formations; Iron ore; Recycled PET; Residue; Synthetic gravel","Concretes; Economics; Gravel; Iron ores; Open pit mining; Ores; Recycling; Tailings; Water absorption; Banded iron formations; Compressive resistance; Concrete productions; Iron ore concentrates; Light weight aggregate; Properties of concretes; Recycled PET; Residue; Iron",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Benosman, A.S., Mouli, M., Taibi, H., Belbachir, M., Senhadji, Y., Behlouli, I., Houivet, D., Mineralogical study of polymer-mortar composites with PET polymer by means of spectroscopic analyses (2012) Mater.

Within the framework of this initiative, this study addresses the use of ceramic aggregates from precast production facilities in order to replace natural aggregates for manufacturing structural concrete for the production of precast prestressed beams. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of the substitution of the fine and coarse fraction of natural aggregates for ceramic brick aggregates in the mechanical properties of concrete, with the aim of applying the results obtained to the subsequent manufacture and testing of prestressed beams commonly used in one-way slabs. The focus of this analysis is on the replacement of the fine fraction of the natural aggregate by the recycled one. However, the coarse aggregate was also substituted. Furthermore, two hardly studied replacement percentages (35% and 70%) were included in the experimental program. The main result obtained was that prestressed beams can be manufactured with up to 35% of the proposed type of ceramic recycled aggregates in order to reach the requirements of the European standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coarse fraction replacement; Fine fraction replacement; Precast concrete; Recycled brick aggregates","Aggregates; Brick; Ceramic materials; Concrete testing; Concretes; Demolition; Manufacture; Precast concrete; Prestressed beams and girders; Recycling; Coarse fractions; Construction and demolition waste; Experimental program; Fine fraction; Impact on the environment; Properties of concretes; Recycled brick; Structural concretes; Concrete aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016), http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php, <>; Commission, E., (2011), COM(2011) 571 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe.

To improve the quality of the RCAs, an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method is proposed to treat RCAs in this study. In this method, RCAs are first soaked in acetic acid solution, in which the acetic acid reacts with cement hydration products attached to the surface of the RCAs. This reaction weakens the attached mortar, making it possible to remove it from the RCAs by mechanical rubbing later. The treated RCAs have lower water absorption and less cement mortar attached. Once used as aggregates in new concrete, these RCAs can enhance the compressive strength of the concrete at 28 days up to 25%. It is safe and clean to apply this new method since no dangerous chemical is used and no detrimental chemicals are introduced into the treated RCAs. More importantly, zero hazardous waste solution is generated since the waste solution of the treatment can be used to produce high value-added products, permanently store CO2, and regenerate acetic acid. As an example, the waste solution of the treatment was used as admixture for new concrete, which improved the strength of the concrete by 14%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acetic acid; Concrete; Mechanical rubbing; Microstructure; Recycled concrete aggregate; Waste solution; Water absorption","Acetic acid; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Compressive strength; Concretes; Cost effectiveness; Hydration; Indicators (chemical); Microstructure; Mortar; Organic acids; pH; Recycling; Waste treatment; Water absorption; Water treatment; Cost-effective methods; Hazardous wastes; Inferior quality; Mechanical rubbing; Natural aggregate; Recycled concrete aggregates; Value added products; Waste solution; Concrete aggregates",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Engineering, ENG: 1000580","This study was partially supported by the National Science Foundation ?

The glass from CRTs suggested being used as raw materials for the production of radiation shielding glass. Cathode ray tubes glass contains considerable amounts of environmentally hazardous toxic wastes, namely heavy metal oxides such as lead oxide (PbO). This method makes CRTs glass a favorable choice to be used as raw material for Radiation Shielding Glass and concrete. The heavy metal oxides increase its density, which make this type of glass nearly equivalent to commercially available shielding glass. CRTs glass have been characterized to determine heavy oxides content, density, refractive index, and radiation shielding properties for different Gamma-Ray energies. Empirical methods have been used by using the Gamma-Ray source cobalt-60 and computational method by using the code XCOM. Measured and calculated values were in a good compatibility. The effects of irradiation by gamma rays of cobalt-60 on the optical transparency for each part of the CRTs glass have been studied. The Results had shown that some parts of CRTs glass have more resistant to Gamma radiation than others. The study had shown that the glass of cathode ray tubes could be recycled to be used as radiation shielding glass. This proposed use of CRT glass is only limited to the available quantity of CRT world-wide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Cathode ray tubes; Cathode rays; Cathodes; Cobalt; Electrodes; Electronic Waste; Gamma rays; Glass; Heavy metals; Radiation; Recycling; Refractive index; Shielding; Toxic materials; Gamma ray sources; Good compatibility; Hazardous toxic wastes; Heavy metal oxides; Optical transparency; Radiation characteristics; Radiation shielding glass; Shielding properties; Radiation shielding; barium oxide; cobalt 60; heavy metal; lead oxide; strontium; Article; cathode ray tube; chemical analysis; controlled study; density; empirical research; gamma radiation; hazardous waste; irradiation; radiation attenuation; radiation energy; radiation shield; radiosensitivity; recycling; refraction index; spectrum",,"barium oxide, 1304-28-5; cobalt 60, 10198-40-0; lead oxide, 1317-36-8, 1335-25-7, 74891-45-5, 79120-33-5; strontium, 7440-24-6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1986), American Institute of Physics Translation Series: Optical Glass; T.S.Izumitani, Hoya Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; New York; Background Document on Recycling Waste from Computers (2000), Prepared by Randall Conrad & Assoc.

This study investigated the use of cement kiln dust, cement by-pass dust combined with powdered incinerator bottom ash) and aggregates (saw-mill silt, concrete demolition waste, and incinerator bottom ash sand) to form unconventional controlled low-strength materials (CLSM). These CLSM mixtures were then compared with traditional CLSMs obtained by combining natural sand with ordinary Portland and sulpho-alluminate cements. A number of different mixtures were prepared and tested to explore the environmental and geo-mechanical properties related to the laying-construction phase and in-situ service. The results indicate the effects and possible limits of each alternative mixture element on the properties of both fresh and hardened CLSMs. The use of alternative binders may result in mixtures with properties comparable to those of reference mixtures. Very fine aggregates (saw-mill silt) significantly improve workability and reduce setting-times, without promoting any strength gain in the long term. Recycled CLSMs proved effective only when used as a substitute for 50% of natural sands. The high concentration of some hazardous contaminants was reduced to acceptable levels using hydrophobic agent and stannous sulphate. Such results encourage the use of unconventional CLSMs as a surrogate for conventional geo-materials in a variety of civil and environmental engineering applications. © 2017","Cement by-pass dust; Cement kiln dust; Controlled low-strength materials; Incinerator bottom ash; Recycling; Saw-mill silt","Aggregates; Ash handling; Ashes; Binders; Bins; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Demolition; Dust; Kilns; Mixtures; Recycling; Silt; By pass; Cement kiln dusts; Construction and demolition waste; Controlled low strength materials; Environmental assessment; Geomechanical properties; Incinerator bottom ash; Industrial by-products; Strength of materials",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Concrete Institute (ACI), Controlled Low-strength Materials (2005), ACI229R-99 ACI Farmington Hills, MI; Folliard, K.J., Du, L., Trejo, D., Halmen, C., Sabol, S., Leshchinsky, D., Development of a Recommended Practice for Use of Controlled Low-strength Material in Highway Construction.

Box 1000, VTT, 02044, Finland","The revised EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD) includes a 70 % target for recovery of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. In order to study the potential change in the resource management of the main C&D waste fractions, as a consequence of fulfilling the WFD target, a Nordic project (ENCORT-CDW) has been performed. Waste fractions studied included asphalt, concrete, bricks, track ballast, gypsum-based construction materials and wood. Recovery scenarios were identified and estimations were made regarding expected savings of primary materials, impact on transport, and pollution and emissions. For wood waste, the main differences between re-use, material recycling and energy recovery were evaluated in a carbon footprint screening based on life cycle assessment methodology. The study concluded that the EU recovery target does not ensure a resource efficient and environmentally sustainable waste recovery in its present form since: It is very sensitive to how the legal definitions of waste and recovery are interpreted in the Member States. This means that certain construction material cycles might not count in the implementation reports while other, less efficient and environmentally safe, recovery processes of the same material will count.It is weight-based and consequently favours large and heavy waste streams. The result is that smaller flows with equal or larger resource efficiency and environmental benefit will be insignificant for reaching the target.It does not distinguish between the various recovery processes, meaning that resource efficient and environmentally safe recovery cannot be given priority.Improved knowledge on C&D waste generation and handling, as well as on content and emissions of dangerous substances, is required to achieve a sustainable recovery. © 2016, The Author(s).","Construction & demolition waste; Life cycle assessment; Recovery; Resource efficiency","Ballast (railroad track); Carbon; Carbon footprint; Demolition; Environmental regulations; Life cycle; Natural resources management; Recovery; Resource allocation; Safe handling; Construction and demolition; Dangerous substances; Demolition wastes; Environmental benefits; Environmentally safe; Eu waste framework directives; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resource efficiencies; Waste management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives, 312 (22), p. 11; Commission Decision of 18 November 2011 establishing rules and calculation methods for verifying compliance with the targets set in Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (notified under document C(2011) 8165) (2011) OJ L, 310 (25), p. 11; Commission Decision of 18 December 2014 amending Decision 2000/532/EC on the list of waste pursuant to Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council text with EEA relevance pursuant to Article 1(4) of Council directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste (2014) OJ L 370/pp, 44-86 (30), p. 12; Arm, M., Wik, O., Engelsen, C.J., Erlandsson, M., Sundqvist, J.-O., Oberender, A., Hjelmar, O., Wahlström, M., ENCORT-CDW—Evaluation of the European recovery target for construction and demolition waste (2014) Nordic Council of Ministers, Nordic Working Papers, 2014 (916). , Accessed 7 July 2016; Eurostat: Eurostat’s database, , Accessed 7 July 2016; Wahlström, M., Laine-Ylijoki, J., Järnström, H., Kaartinen, T., Erlandsson, M., Palm Cousins, A., Wik, O., Jørgensen, A., Environmentally sustainable construction products and materials—assessment of release and emissions (2014) Nordic innovation report, 2014, p. 03. , http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2014/Environmentally%20Sustainable%20Construction%20Products%20and%20Materials_Final_report.pdf; Barry, K., Daniel, J.S., Foxlow, J., Gray, K., An evaluation of reclaimed asphalt shingles in hot mix asphalt by varying sources and quantity of reclaimed asphalt shingles (2014) Road Mater.

The ecological suitability for subsequent applications is proven based on their chemical composition, the content of harmful substances, and their potential leakage into the surrounding environment. The ecological criteria are always determined according to the requirements of the legislation in force and according to the demand for a specific type of waste and its utilization. However, the specification of limit values for the evaluation of the content of harmful substances and other monitored parameters is a questionable issue. This article presents the results of an experimental program focused on the monitoring of the environmental risks of recycled aggregates. The analysis of the results of laboratory tests of recycled bricks, recycled concrete, and soil with aggregates points out the difficulty in complying with the conditions for the potential utilization of these recycled materials on ground surfaces. The objective of these tests is to compare the results of laboratory tests of recycled bricks, recycled concrete, and soil with aggregates obtained from different recycling facilities to the limit values stipulated by legislative regulations. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","construction and demolition waste; ecotoxicological tests; environmental risks; hazardous substances; recycled aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Angulo, S.C., Mueller, A., (2009) Mater.

This paper makes an attempt at addressing the eventual practice of industrial ecology in SIDS with Mauritius as a case study. Three major polluting industries namely the slaughterhouse, edible oil refinery and the scrap metal recycling plant have been considered with a particular focus on the recycling of electric arc furnace slag as concrete aggregates. Along with the potential areas of applications for the different waste materials, this research has also addressed the benefits, barriers and factors for implementing industrial symbiosis projects within SIDS. The most striking benefits are the preservation of the fauna and flora of the island and reduced dependency on developed countries for the importation of raw materials while the absence of a landfill disposal fee for non-hazardous wastes and lack of awareness of industrial symbiosis projects have been identified as the main barriers. To overcome these barriers, a shift from manufacture-consume-dispose to manufacture-consume-recycle-manufacture is recommended. This study concludes that if a sustainable island is anticipated in the future, a combination of recycling options along with all necessary factors such as technology, funding from international organisations, regulatory framework and involvement of stakeholders, general public and non-governmental organisations is required. Ultimately, this would result in the establishment of networks among source and sink industries, thus being in harmony with the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Recycling; Resources; Small island developing state; Waste management","Concrete aggregates; Ecology; Electric arcs; Electric furnaces; Industrial research; Manufacture; Metal refineries; Recycling; Scrap metal; Scrap metal reprocessing; Slags; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Electric arc furnace slags; Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Non-governmental organisations; Regulatory frameworks; Resources; Scrap metal recycling; Small island developing state; Waste management",,,,,"University of Mauritius, UoM; Mauritius Research Council, MRC","The author would like to express her gratitude to the University of Mauritius and the Mauritius Research Council for the logistics and financial support provided.

The quantification model is based on the work breakdown system (WBS) of construction budgets. Five urbanization projects are evaluated; two are industrial and three residential. The quantities, budget, and ecological footprint (EF) are determined. The EF evaluation follows the same methodology as defined by the authors for construction projects but with several new incorporations, such as the quantification for the felling of trees and the machinery footprint. The result shows that 98% of the C&DW generated is due to earthworks and tree felling. An overwhelming 97% of the EF is due to fuel consumption by on-site machinery and construction materials. Finally, a new scenario is proposed in which the soil is 100% reused and the inert waste is crushed and used as concrete aggregate, which reduces the EF by more than 20% in all cases analysed. The results show that it is possible to quantify the integral impact within construction projects of the application of recycling and of reuse strategies by means of a WBS. Finally, from a construction project perspective, the traditional model for waste management and economic control can be completed with an environmental analysis using the EF indicator. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological footprint; Economic impact; Urbanization; Waste","Budget control; Demolition; Ecology; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Machinery; Waste management; Wastes; Construction and demolition waste; Construction projects; Ecological and economic; Ecological footprint; Economic impacts; Environmental analysis; Urbanization; Waste quantifications; Project management; fossil fuel; construction industry; demolition; ecological footprint; economic impact; environmental impact assessment; industrial waste; recycling; strategic approach; urbanization; Article; budget; building material; carbon footprint; construction and demolition waste; economic evaluation; energy cost; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; hazardous waste; municipal solid waste; recycling; residential area; rural area; Spain; tree; urbanization; waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/fomentoyvivienda/portal-web/web/areas/vivienda/texto/28c8aa4d-2483-11e0-a6d1-9169d730d750, ACCD, 2014.

In this study, the recycling potential of waste concrete as aggregates in construction activities was studied. The metal leaching from the recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) collected from the demolition site of a 50 year old building, was evaluated by performing three different leaching tests (compliance, availability and Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure). The metal leaching was found mostly within the permissible limit except for Hg. Several tests were performed to determine the physical and mechanical properties of the fine and coarse aggregates produced from recycled concrete. The properties of recycled aggregates were found to be satisfactory for their utilization in road construction activities. The suitability of using recycled fine and coarse aggregates with Portland pozzolanic cement to make a sustainable and environmental friendly concrete mix design was also analyzed. No significant difference was observed in the compressive strength of various concrete mixes prepared by natural and recycled aggregates. However, only the tensile strength of the mix prepared with 25% recycled fine aggregates was comparable to that of the control concrete. For other mixes, the tensile strength of the concrete was found to drop significantly. In summary, RCA should be considered seriously as a building material for road construction, mass concrete works, lightly reinforced sections, etc. The present work will be useful for the waste managers and policy makers particularly in developing nations where proper guidelines are still lacking. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Concrete waste recycling; Demolition waste; Heavy metal leaching; Mechanical properties of recycled aggregates; Recycled aggregates","Aggregates; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete mixers; Concrete mixtures; Concretes; Construction industry; Demolition; Heavy metals; Leaching; Mechanical properties; Mercury (metal); Recycling; Road construction; Roads and streets; Tensile strength; Waste disposal; Concrete wastes; Construction and demolition waste; Demolition wastes; Metal leaching; Physical and mechanical properties; Recycled aggregates; Recycled concrete aggregates; Toxic characteristic leaching procedures; Concrete aggregates; cement; concrete; metal; industrial waste; aggregate; concrete; construction method; demolition; developing world; experimental study; heavy metal; leaching; policy making; recycling; waste disposal; waste management; Article; compressive strength; construction work; controlled study; environmental policy; highway; leaching; recycling; tensile strength; analysis; building industry; building material; industrial waste; materials testing; procedures; recycling; waste disposal; waste management; Construction Industry; Construction Materials; Industrial Waste; Materials Testing; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management",,"Industrial Waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2010), Standard Practice for Classification of Soil for Engineering Purpose (Unified Soil Classification System).

Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns. The map of population density within built-up areas reveals where the construction sector is emerging at the county scale. Field observations highlight the existence of illegal disposal practices of construction waste in the proximity of settlements or water bodies. This waste stream should receive proper attention in following years in order to achieve recycling and recovery targets imposed by EU regulations. © SGEM2017.

The cultivation of rice and plantation of sugarcane results in various types of residues: rice straw, rice husk and for sugarcane: bagasse, press mud or filter cake and molasses. During the harvesting of rice crop, the top portion grains are harvested and transported to the mill, while the stem (straw), rice husk, leaf and sugarcane residues are left on the field. It could be an appropriate to reuse and utilize a portion of crop residue for liquid fuels or combusted/gasified to produce electricity and heat. This chapter provides an overview of solid waste residues for energy production and also their toxic effects in the environment an open burning process. This chapter reviews the process for the production of ethanol, charcoal, paper and building materials (concrete, cement, bricks) from biomass. Additionally, a significant role of rice husk in silica production and then synthesized silicon nanoparticle use in biomedical research (i.e. drug delivery, cancer treatment etc.) has been introduced. Interestingly, the role of bio-computational approach of silica nanoparticle for drug designing also discussed. Comprehensive review processing of vermicomposting is discussed as a potential tool to bio-convert rice or sugarcane residues into enabling recycling of organic matter or organic fertilizer. After harvesting of rice or sugarcane, these residues remain on agriculture land and processed further for open burning by farmers. This open burning has hazardous effects on human health and the environment, is also discussed in this article. This article provides the possible pathway of mechanism and future recommendations for the use of agriculture waste as a bio-resource. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Charcoal; Rice husk; Rice straw; Silicon nanoparticle; Sugarcane; Toxicology","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Charcoal; Crops; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Harvesting; Nanoparticles; Silica; Solid wastes; Sugar cane; Synthesis (chemical); Agricultural productions; Computational approach; Environmental toxicology; Rice husk; Rice straws; Silica nanoparticles; Silicon nanoparticles; Toxicology; Molasses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adam, F., Chew, T.S., As, J., A simple template-free sol-gel synthesis of spherical nanosilica from agricultural biomass (2011) J Sol-Gel Sci Technol, 59, pp. 580-583; Adani, F., Genevini, P.L., Gasperi, F., Zorzi, G., A new index of organic matter stability (1995) Compost Sci Utilization, 3, pp. 25-37; Andrade, S.J., Cristale, J., Silva, F.S., Contribution of sugar-cane harvesting season to atmospheric contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Araraquara city, Southeast Brazil (2010) Atmos Environ, 44, pp. 2913-2919; Andreae, M.O., Merlet, P., Emission of trace gases and aerosols from biomass burning (2001) Glob Biogeochem Cycles, 15, pp. 955-966; Azevedo, D.A., Santos, C., Aquino Neto, F.R., Identification and seasonal variation of atmospheric organic pollutants in Campos dos Goytacazes Brazil (2002) Atmos Environ, 36, pp. 2383-2395; Bansal, S., Kapoor, K.K., Vermicomposting of crop residues and cattle dung with Eisenia foetida (2000) Biores Technol, 73, pp. 95-98; Bank, T.K., Sahu, B., Swain, V., Nanosilica—from medicine to pest control (2008) Parasitol Res, 103, pp. 253-258; Batelle, L., (1975) Parasitol Res, , Columbus, Ohio, August 1975.

This substitution of aggregate is an integration approach to preserve the natural resources and environment as well as develop the alternative recycled aggregate material to meet 3R principle and sustainable development. Bakelite waste is prohibited from disposing of sanitary landfill and direct burning because of hazardous disposal and emission reasons .There are many studies of plastic aggregate to substitute natural coarse aggregate especially PET and PE aggregate. However, there is no study of Waste Bakelite Aggregate (WBA) mixed in concrete in Thailand. This study aim is investigating the mechanical properties of Waste Bakelite Aggregate Concrete (WBAC) compare to conventional concrete (CC).The methodology is based on an experimental program by testing of concrete specimens. The data obtained from sample test according to BS standard. These test results present compressive strength of all samples both CC and WBAC. The relationship charts between mechanical properties and the waste Bakelite aggregate replacement percentage will be illustrated including the compressive strength predictable equation model. Furthermore, the chemical extraction test of waste Bakelite aggregate concrete and the durability of WBAC are notified for the utilization. WBAC is an alternative material that can be applied to the non-structural concrete product to replace the natural aggregate and helpful in waste plastic pollution mitigation. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Conventional Concrete (CC); Waste Bakelite Aggregate (WBA); Waste Bakelite Aggregate Concrete (WBAC)","Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete products; Concrete testing; Durability; Land fill; Phenolic resins; Plastic recycling; Polyethylene terephthalates; Software testing; Sustainable development; Aggregate concrete; Alternative materials; Chemical extractions; Conventional concrete; Experimental program; Integration approach; Non-structural concretes; Recycled aggregates; Aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kongkarat, S., Khanna, R., Koshy, P., O'Kane, P., Sahajwalla, V., Use of wastebakeliteas a raw material resource for recarburization in steelmaking processes (2011) Steel Research Int., 82 (10), pp. 1228-1239; Crespy, D., Bozonnet, M., Meier, M., 100 years of bakelite, the material of a 1000 uses (2008) ChemikerAngew.Chem.Int.Ed., 47, pp. 3322-3328; Dharanidharan, S., Srivithya, N., Meena, N., Experimental study on the flexural behavior of e-waste plastics in concrete (2015) Int.

Mechanical and physical properties, detailed environmental performances, and microstructure analysis were carried out. Meanwhile, the early hydration process and hydrated products of ODPR concrete were analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results indicated that ODPR could not be categorize into hazardous wastes. ODPR had specific pozzolanic characteristic and the use of ODPR had certain influence on slump and compressive strength of concrete. The best workability and optimal compressive strength were achieved with the help of 35% ODPR. Environmental performance tests came to conclusion that ODPR as recycled aggregates and admixture for the preparation of concrete, from the technique perspective, were the substance of mere environmental contamination. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Admixture; Aggregate; ODPR; Recycling; Shale gas","Aggregates; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete products; Concretes; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Environmental management; Fly ash; Hydration; Microstructure; Pyrolysis; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Shale; Shale gas; Shale oil; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Admixture; Compressive strength of concrete; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Environmental contamination; Environmental performance; Fourier transform infrared; Mechanical and physical properties; ODPR; Well drilling; 1,1,1 trichloroethane; 1,1,2 trichloroethane; 1,2 dibromo 3 chloropropane; 1,2 dichlorobenzene; 1,2,3 trichlorobenzene; 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene; 1,3 dichlorobenzene; 1,4 dichlorobenzene; arsenic acid; barium; benzo[a]pyrene; beryllium; cadmium; chromium; concrete; copper; dibromochloromethane; dibromomethane; hexachlorobutadiene; lead; mercury; nickel; petroleum; phosphate; selenium; silver; tetrachloroethylene; toluene; toxic substance; zinc ion; compressive strength; concrete; drilling; environmental fate; hazardous waste; microstructure; pyrolysis; recycling; shale gas; Article; compressive strength; controlled study; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental protection; gas; hazardous waste; infrared spectroscopy; leaching; micromorphology; oil shale; particle size; pH; pyrolysis; scanning electron microscopy; solid waste; X ray diffraction",,"1,1,1 trichloroethane, 71-55-6; 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 79-00-5; 1,2 dibromo 3 chloropropane, 67708-83-2, 96-12-8; 1,2 dichlorobenzene, 95-50-1; 1,2,3 trichlorobenzene, 87-61-6; 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene, 120-82-1; 1,3 dichlorobenzene, 541-73-1; 1,4 dichlorobenzene, 106-46-7; arsenic acid, 15584-04-0, 7778-39-4; barium, 7440-39-3; benzo[a]pyrene, 50-32-8; beryllium, 7440-41-7; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; dibromochloromethane, 124-48-1; dibromomethane, 74-95-3; hexachlorobutadiene, 87-68-3; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; nickel, 7440-02-0; petroleum, 8002-05-9; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; selenium, 7782-49-2; silver, 7440-22-4; tetrachloroethylene, 127-18-4; toluene, 108-88-3; zinc ion, 23713-49-7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Robinson, J.P., Kingman, S.W., Snape, C.E., Bradshaw, S.M., Bradley, M.S.A., Shang, H., Barranco, R., Scale-up and design of a continuous microwave treatment system for the processing of oil-contaminated drill cuttings (2010) Chem.

While it means economic growth, the waste generated by the construction industry has always posed a problem. Most of the construction waste is made up of concrete. The inert and non-hazardous concrete waste, suffers from weak enforcement provisions and this further escalates it into large scale landfill dumping and illegal dumping. The consequences of improper waste management are potentially alarming. With the rising concerns of waste management and global carbon concentrations, this study aims to evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated with concrete waste materials and to identify the best alternative in managing the concrete waste. A comprehensive life cycle assessment framework is proposed to assess the environmental impacts associated with the upstream and downstream of concrete waste life cycle; from raw material extraction to material processing, distribution to disposal or recycle. This study analysed the life cycle system in three scenarios: Scenario 1 depicts the cradle-To-grave scenario where concrete waste is sent to landfill without treatment and recycling. Scenario 2 and 3 depict the cradle-To-cradle scenarios in which the concrete waste is cyclically recycled into aggregates and reuse as road base material and reuse in recycled aggregate concrete production. With the compilation of a systematic life cycle inventory of relevant energy, fuel, and process emissions as inputs and released carbon emissions as outputs, this study helps in interpreting the environmental impacts of different waste management into a series of quantitative measures for more informed decision making. A construction project case study is modelled and analysed in the life cycle assessment framework to demonstrate the model's applicability. Results from this study suggest that the recycle of concrete waste into aggregates and reuse in recycled aggregate concrete production have the least GHG impact to the environment at 0.094 tCO2. Recycling of concrete waste for road base material emits 0.095 tCO2 and followed by landfilling at 0.139 tCO2. This model intended to be an analysis and decisionmaking tool while embracing sustainable development stewardship.

This study, through laboratory testing and analysis, evaluated the low-cost construction waste product, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as a remediation material for AMD. Column leach tests (CLTs) were conducted to determine the effects of the four different RCAs on pH, electrical conductivity, iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in AMD. Results of the CLTs suggest RCAs can effectively raise pH of the AMD and reduce concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Fe in AMD. The pH of AMD prior to treatment ranged from 2 to 4, and after treatment with the RCAs the pH of the AMD increased to above 11. Following RCA treatment, Cr concentrations in the AMD decreased by 22 to 62%, Cr concentrations reduced average of 85%, and Fe concentrations declined by over 98%. © ASCE.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Concretes; Drainage; Recycling; Acid mine drainage; After-treatment; Cr concentration; Electrical conductivity; Laboratory testing; Low-cost construction; Mining operations; Recycled concrete aggregates; Concrete aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akcil, A., Koldas, S., Acid mine drainage (AMD): Causes, treatment and case studies (2006) Journal of Cleaner Production, (14), pp. 1139-1145; Cetin, B., Aydilek, A.H., Guney, Y., Leaching of trace metals from high carbon fly ash stabilized highway base layers (2012) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 58, pp. 8-17; Elberling, B., Balic-Zunic, T., Edsberg, A., Spatial variations and controls of acid mine drainage generation (2003) Environmental Geology, 43 (7), pp. 806-813; (2009) National Primary Drinking Water Standards, , (EPA 816-F-09-004); Gelhar, L.W., Welty, C., Rehfeldt, K.R., Critical review of data on field-scale dispersion in aquifers (1992) Water Resources Research, 28 (7), pp. 1955-1974; Golab, A., Peterson, M.A., Indraratna, B., Selection of potential reactive materials for a permeable reactive barrier for remediating acidic groundwater in acid sulphate soil terrains (2006) Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, (39), pp. 209-223; Gray, N.F., Environmental impact and remediation of acid mine drainage: A mangement problem (1997) Environmental Geology, (30), pp. 62-71; (2014) Homestake Mining Company, , http://www.homestakevisitorcenter.com, Retrieved July 8, 2016; Indraratna, B., Regmi, G., Nghiem, L., Golab, A., Performance of a PRB for the remediation of acidic groundwater in acid sulfate soil terrain (2010) Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering, 135 (7), p. 9; Lottermoser, B., (2010) Mine Wastes: Characterization, Treatment and Envionmental Impacts, , (3 ed.).

As the synthesized additive was added into the AC mix, the water vapor produced from the thermal decomposition of Ca(OH)2@zeolite NC, even at low temperature, greatly reduced the asphalt viscosity and hence the emission of air pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM). The presence of water vapors in the feed suppressed the VOC adsorption capacity of zeolite due to the competitive adsorption of water vapors on the active sites. In addition, the enhanced catalytic activity of Ca(OH)2@zeolite was attributed to the synergistic catalysis between the super acidic and basic Brønsted sites of aldehydes and Lewis acid-base sites of Ca(OH)2@zeolite, which are the bridging OH groups in SiO44- and AlO2-, due to thermal degradation of Ca(OH)2. The relatively less viscous asphalt is effectively mixed with coarse aggregates to coat or bind the particles, which greatly reduces the PM emissions compared to zeolite. Compared to the hot mix asphalt (HMA) with no additive at 180 °C, the addition of Ca(OH)2@zeolite NC at a concentration up to 6 wt% of the asphalt fraction into the warm mix asphalt (WMA) at 120 °C greatly reduced the atmospheric emissions (by 61-98% for VOCs, 52-92% for aldehydes, and 85% for PM2.5). The resulting large reduction of the working temperature during AC production and atmospheric emissions of hazardous chemicals will reduce workers' health risks. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boczkaj, G., Przyjazny, A., Kaminski, M., (2014) Chemosphere, 107, pp. 23-30; Faber, P., Drewnick, F., Borrmann, S., (2015) Atmos.

This chapter attempts to provide a narrative based on experience and the events of the last decades. The past 25 years have seen the rise of the Basel Convention as a key international environmental instrument which aims at reducing the export of hazardous waste and ensuring that any such waste be managed in a way to protect human health and the environment. There are two interconnected factors that explain why the Convention only partially succeeded in achieving its aims. First, trade issues came into collision with the control system of the Convention, and second, a large majority of countries parties to the Convention did not and still do not possess the capacity to manage the hazardous waste they generate in an environmentally sound way. Throughout its history, parties made constant efforts to keep a balance between environmental protection and trade while implementing the Convention. This resulted in reducing the potential of the Convention to become a universal landmark for the environmentally sound waste management based on principles applicable to hazardous waste. As a consequence, and despite its concrete achievements, the Convention disappeared from the radar screen of politicians and became a technical instrument. The issue of recycling and recovery was never resolved in a satisfactory manner within the scope of the Convention. From an historical perspective, one could witness a loss of influence of the Basel Convention. One reason is that the parties, being preoccupied by the way the Convention would relate to trade, did not invest in exploring its potential to contribute to the emerging Green Economy movement. However, it might not be too late to face up to this new challenge. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2016.

Steel slag can be profitable used for civil applications such as road surfaces layer, foundations and embankments or concrete aggregates. However, a strong limitation to their use is due to the presence of toxic metals (Ba, Cr, V, Mo, .) that can be released into the environment in particular conditions, especially for unbound products in which the slag can come into contact with water. In this study, the results obtained on about 70 slag samples are presented. The investigated slag were provided by several Italian and European EAF plants and they are associated to different steel grades production: reinforcing bar steels; high-alloyed steels and quality steels (Table 3). The analysis allowed to identify the main factors that control the release of hazardous metals (chemical composition and microstructure) and to develop a stabilization process that transforms the slag in a safe artificial aggregate, free from environmental problems. For example, Ba leaching seems controlled by MgO and CaO with a quadratic equation, whereas Cr leaching increases as the slag basicity index increases (Figure 3). The crystalline phases responsible to control metals leaching were identified: larnite is main responsible for Ba leaching, whereas brownmillerite seems responsible for V and Cr leaching. Ca-chromite induces very high Cr leaching in high basicity slag. Gehlenite and kirschsteinite demonstrated to be stable at the leaching test conditions, and thus were selected as favorable phases to be promoted (Figure 4). The obtained results were used to design a stabilization treatment able to transform dangerous phases into safe one (Figure 7). The stabilized slag have shown a reduced tendency to metals leaching and a structural stability even in the long term (Table 4, Figure 8).","Chemical composition; Eaf slag; Leaching test; Microstructure; Recycling; Stabilization treatment","Alkalinity; Chemical analysis; Concrete aggregates; Electric arcs; Electric furnace process; Furnaces; Leaching; Metals; Microstructure; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Slags; Stability; Stabilization; Structural metals; Artificial aggregates; Chemical compositions; Electric arc furnace slags; Environmental problems; Leaching test; Stabilization process; Stabilization treatments; Structural stabilities; Electric furnaces",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Registro Prodotti Certificati da Rina Services S.p.A.

Leachates were produced by means of modified standard column leaching tests and pH-stat batch tests. Due to elevated contents of chromium and lead, as well as due to high chloride concentrations in the first leachate from column tests at L/S 0.1, recycling of the concrete as a construction material in groundworks is likely to be restricted according to Swedish guidelines. The studied pesticide compounds appear to be relatively mobile at the materials own pH > 12, 12, 9 and 7. Potential leaching of pesticide residues from recycled concrete to ground water and surface water might exceed water quality guidelines for the remediation site and the EU Water Framework Directive. Results of this study stress the necessity to systematically study the mechanism behind mobility of organic contaminants from alkaline construction and demolition wastes rather than rely on total content limit values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","C&D waste; Concrete; Leaching; Pesticides; Recycling; Solid waste","Alkalinity; Carbon; Chlorine compounds; Concretes; Contamination; Demolition; Environmental regulations; Groundwater; Heavy metals; Leaching; Organic carbon; Phenols; Recycling; Solid wastes; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water quality; Chloride concentrations; Column leaching tests; Construction and demolition waste; Dissolved organic carbon; Eu-water framework directives; Leachate concentrations; Organic contaminant; Water quality guidelines; Pesticides; chloride; chlorocresol; chlorophenol; chromium; concrete; ground water; heavy metal; lead; organic carbon; pesticide; pesticide residue; phenol derivative; phenolic organic pesticide; phenoxy acid derivative; sulfate; surface water; unclassified drug; industrial waste; water pollutant; chloride; concrete; dissolved organic carbon; heavy metal; leaching; pesticide; phenolic compound; recycling; sulfate; Article; building material; chemical analysis; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); contamination; controlled study; demolition waste; leaching; maximum allowable concentration; pH; practice guideline; recycling; solid waste; Sweden; water quality; analysis; industrial waste; procedures; standards; waste management; water pollutant; Sweden; Construction Materials; Industrial Waste; Recycling; Sweden; Waste Management; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"chloride, 16887-00-6; chlorocresol, 1321-10-4, 59-50-7; chlorophenol, 25167-80-0; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; sulfate, 14808-79-8; Industrial Waste; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arulrajah, A., Piratheepan, J., Disfani, M., Bo, M., Geotechnical and geoenvironmental properties of recycled construction and demolition materials in pavement subbase applications (2013) J.

If it is disposed of at landfills, it would cause detrimental effects for our surrounding environment and ecosystems due to its high pH value as well as heavy metal contamination and accumulation. A new method in this study has been introduced to effectively reuse CSW in new construction products. In this method, the calcium-silicate rich CSW in the fresh state was considered as a cementitious paste as well as a CO2 capture medium. The experimental results showed that the pH values of the collected CSWs stored for 28 days ranged from 12.5 to 13.0 and a drastic decrease of pH value was detected after accelerated mineral carbonation. The theoretically calculated CO2 sequestration extent of CSWs was from 27.05% to 31.23%. The practical water to solid ratio in the fresh CSW varied from 0.76 to 1.12, which had a significant impact on the compressive strength of the mixture with CSWs. After subjecting to accelerated mineral carbonation, rapid initial strength development and lower drying shrinkage for the prepared concrete mixture were achieved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerated mineral carbonation; CO2 sequestration; Concrete production; Concrete slurry waste","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Compressive strength; Concrete mixers; Concrete mixtures; Concrete products; Concretes; Heavy metals; Minerals; Mixtures; pH; Silicates; Concrete productions; Construction products; Heavy metal contamination; Mineral carbonation; Ready mixed concrete plants; Strength development; Surrounding environment; Water-to-solid ratios; Ready mixed concrete; aluminum oxide; calcium; calcium silicate; carbon dioxide; cement; concrete; magnesium oxide; magnetite; silicate; silicon dioxide; sulfate; titanium dioxide; water; carbon sequestration; compressive strength; concrete; experimental study; heavy metal; landfill; pollutant; shrinkage; slurry; solid waste; Article; compressive strength; concrete slurry waste; pH; recycling; solid; waste; water content",,"aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; calcium silicate, 1344-95-2, 13983-17-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; magnesium oxide, 1309-48-4, 1317-74-4; magnetite, 1309-38-2, 1317-61-9; silicate, 12627-13-3; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; sulfate, 14808-79-8; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; water, 7732-18-5",,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","This work was funded by the Innovation and Technology Support Programme Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme (ITSP-TCFS) and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Projects of Strategic Importance).

The study focuses on the compressive strength and release of elements from the geopolymer concrete samples. The toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) was used to determine release of potentially hazardous heavy metals (PHHMs) and other constituents of potential concern (COPCs) from the geopolymer concrete and also to identify if the material should be categorized as either hazardous or nonhazardous. It was found that replacing virgin aggregates with RCA had a small impact on the compressive strength of the concrete, reducing it by a maximum of 34%. As measured by toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP), release of As was reduced by adding RCA. The leached concentrations of the elements, Ba, Cd, Cr, and Pb were found to be below TCLP regulatory limits. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Elements; Geopolymer; Leachability; Recycled concrete aggregate","Chemical elements; Compressive strength; Concretes; Geopolymers; Hazards; Heavy metals; Inorganic polymers; Leaching; Lead; Recycling; Toxicity; Geopolymer; Geopolymer concrete; Hazardous heavy metals; Leachability; Leaching characteristics; Recycled concrete aggregates; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedures; Toxicity characteristics leaching procedures; Concrete aggregates; aggregate; cement; compressive strength; concentration (composition); concrete; polymer; toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alonso, S., Palomo, A., Alkaline activation of metakaolin and calcium hydroxide mixtures: Influence of temperature, activator concentration and solids ratio (2001) Mater.

Hence, several methods have been developed, like energetic, material, thermo-mechanical and chemical recycling of PET. Most frequently, PET-waste is incinerated for energy recovery, used as additive in concrete composites or glycolysed to yield mixtures of monomers and undefined oligomers. While energetic and thermo-mechanical recycling entail downcycling of the material, chemical recycling requires considerable amounts of chemicals and demanding processing steps entailing toxic and ecological issues. This review provides a thorough survey of PET-recycling including energetic, material, thermo-mechanical and chemical methods. It focuses on chemical methods describing important reaction parameters and yields of obtained reaction products. While most methods yield monomers, only a few yield undefined low molecular weight oligomers for impaired applications (dispersants or plasticizers). Further, the present work presents an alternative chemical recycling method of PET in comparison to existing chemical methods. © BME-PT.","Degradation; Monomers; Oligomers; Poly(ethylene terephthalate); Recycling","Concrete mixtures; Degradation; Ethylene; Indicators (chemical); Monomers; Oligomers; Polyethylene terephthalates; Solvents; Chemical recycling; Concrete composites; Energy recovery; Low molecular weight oligomers; Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET); Processing steps; Reaction parameters; Thermo-mechanical; Recycling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paszun, D., Spychaj, T., Chemical recycling of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (1997) Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 36, pp. 1373-1383; Lepoittevin, B., Roger, P., Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (2011) Handbook of engineering and speciality thermoplastics: Polyethers and polyesters, pp. 97-126. , (eds.: Thomas S., Visakh P.M.)

Thus, it was suggested that CRT panel glass be used as aggregates of concrete blocks and clay bricks. Samples of blocks and bricks were fabricated with CRT powders and tested to measure their strength and absorption rate to determine their qualities, and environmental soundness was determined by measuring the leaching rate of hazardous metals. For concrete blocks, CRT panel glass powders incorporated as aggregates up to 40 % replacing stone powder was proposed as the proper condition for manufacturing blocks. Around 2 % of CRT panel incorporated into clay brick to substitute Kaoline was suggested to fabricate the best quality of clay brick. Results of leaching test met the criteria with much less concentration of hazardous metals, even lead compound containing in the CRT funnel. To conclude, the use of CRT panel powder after crushing it to the proper size as an aggregate of concrete blocks or clay bricks could be one of the appropriate alternatives to recycle for CRT glass waste being generated drastically in a short term. © 2015, Springer Japan.","Clay bricks; Concrete blocks; CRT (cathode ray tube); Funnel; Panel; Recycling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreola, F., Barbieri, L., Corradi, A., Lancellotti, I., Falcone, R., Hreglich, S., Glass-ceramics obtained by the recycling of end of life cathode ray tubes glasses (2005) Waste Manage, 25, pp. 183-189; Xu, Q., Li, G., He, W., Huang, J., Shi, X., Cathode ray tube (CRT) recycling: current capabilities in China and research progress (2012) Waste Manage, 32, pp. 1566-1574; Mear, F., Yot, P., Cambon, M., Ribes, M., The characterization of waste cathode ray tube glass (2006) Waste Manage, 26, pp. 1468-1476; Chen, M., Zhang, F.S., Zhu, J., Lead recovery and the feasibility of foam glass production from funnel glass of dismantled cathode ray tube through pyrovacuum process (2009) J Hazard Mater, 161, pp. 1109-1113; Kim, D., Quinlan, M., Yen, T.F., Encapsulation of lead from hazardous CRT glass wastes using biopolymer cross-linked concrete systems (2009) Waste Manage, 29, pp. 321-328; Cho, S.J., Lee, J.S., Lee, K.B., Seo, Y.C., Kim, B.S., A study on recycling of CRT glass waste (2011) J Korea Soc Waste Manage, 28 (4), pp. 437-442; A study on the plans to improve recycling of CRT glass waste (2010) Korean Association of Electronics Environment; Anderson, M., Commercial viability of masonry products from CRT panel glass (2008) Glass Technical Report of WRAP; Material recovery from waste cathode ray tubes (CRTs), the waste and resource action programme (2004) Project code: GLA15-006; Hui, Z., Sun, W., Study of properties of mortar containing cathode ray tubes (CRT) glass as replacement for river sand fine aggregate (2011) Constr Build Mater, 25, pp. 4059-4064; Romero, D., James, J., Mora, R., Hays, C.D., Study on the mechanical and environmental properties of concrete containing cathode ray tube glass aggregate (2013) Waste Manage, 33, pp. 1659-1666; Ling, T.-C., Poon, C.-S., Use of recycled CRT funnel glass as fine aggregate in dry-mixed concrete paving plocks (2014) J Clean Prod, 68, pp. 209-215; Ling, T.-C., Poon, C.-S., Utilization of recycled glass derived from cathode ray tube glass as fine aggregate in cement mortar (2011) J Hazard Mater, 192, pp. 451-456; Standards, K., Concrete interlocking block for side walk and road (2009) Korean Standards Association KS F, p. 4419; Standards, K., (2012) Clay brick.

The economic benefits of the treatment, the service performance, and the leaching toxicity were analyzed. The results showed that the cement hydrates were transformed into tobermorite in the stone solidifying process when fine quartz sand was added and a high-temperature, high-pressure, high-humidity environment was used to manufacture C80PHC concrete. The density and strength of the concrete increased, which reduced the toxic leaching channel volume. Furthermore, the toxic components of MSWI fly ash were immobilized by the containment and solidification of tobermorite, which stopped toxic compounds leaching out. The results also showed that the method could create a recycling use for the tobermorite with demolding and an autoclaving compressive strength that satisfy the requirements for C80PHC concrete. The economic cost of the treatment was about 108.1 yuan/t, without adding material and equipment costs, and the area of land used. Therefore, the treatment is cost-effective, environmentally-friendly, and safe because it can achieve the required level of harmless disposal at low costs. © 2016, Science Press.

The great advantage of the underwater explosion is especially noticeable where excessive comminution needs to be avoided in order to increase the degree of liberation or reduce the size of hazardous or composite materials. The main finding of this work is that a controlled underwater explosion, a contactless method, ensured the liberation of valuable components from the mounting matrix by generating enough pressure in solids during the transfer of the pulse through the medium (i.e. water). In other words, high-pressure pulses induced the liberation of valuable components that have a boundary with less valuable matrix. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the growing soil degradation worldwide, the need for more food of good quality and therefore the intensified agriculture, it is important to develop recycling plans even for those types of treated AW (e.g., composts) that are not considered hazardous. Two strategic approaches for safe and sustainable landspreading of organic wastes are proposed, depending on wastes properties and hazard potential, i.e., an approach appropriate for traditionally used wastes (manures and composts) and another approach for wastes that are potentially hazardous or hazardous and should only be reused under specific restrictions. Both approaches foresee concrete steps, require close cooperation between farmers and local/regional authorities, and are appropriate to ensure environmental sustainability at AW recycling or disposal areas. Desktop and web application tools are also presented that are anticipated to assist authorities in implementing their monitoring strategies. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Agricultural wastes; Local; Regional authorities; Risk assessment models; Soil; Soil monitoring; Soil policy; Waste disposal; Web-GIS","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Air quality; Composting; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Hazards; Recycling; Risk assessment; Soil conservation; Soils; Sustainable development; Wastes; Local; Regional authorities; Risk assessment models; Soil monitoring; Web-GIS; Waste disposal; GIS; recycling; risk assessment; soil degradation; sustainability; waste disposal; waste management; agricultural waste landspreading; Article; bioremediation; compost; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; hazardous waste; human; manure; organic waste; recycling; risk assessment; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil management; soil protection; soil quality; solid waste management; tillage; waste disposal; water analysis; agriculture; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; industrial waste; prevention and control; procedures; soil; statistics and numerical data; industrial waste; manure; soil; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Industrial Waste; Manure; Recycling; Soil",,"Industrial Waste; Manure; Soil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arshad, M.A., Martin, S., Identifying critical limits for soil quality indicators in agro-systems (2002) Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 88, pp. 153-160; Brinton, F.W., Compost quality standards and guidelines.

However, their use is limited by the presence of polluting chemical elements (chromium (Cr), barium (Ba), Vanadium(V), etc.) that can be dangerous to humans and the environment. Thus, chemical and structural stability is a fundamental requirement, especially when the slag may come in contact with water. Therefore, the interaction between slag and water is key, in order to classify the slag as a safe raw material. In this work, the effect of slag chemical composition on the chemical leaching of about seventy EAF carbon steel slags of different production steel grades was investigated. Standard leaching tests (24 h at 10 l/kg) in deionized water on slag bulks were performed and the results were correlated with the slag chemical composition. The survey has made possible defining the safe chemical composition areas on the main ternary diagrams, able to transfer stability to the slag. The results obtained indicate the water/slag ratio as the most important factor in the release of polluting substances, also identifying a critical scenario for slag recycling. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of partial replacement of the waste compact discs (WCDs) on the fundamental mechanical and strength properties of the WCDs-modified concrete mixtures were investigated. The properties included workability, bulk density, compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength. Compared to the control or reference concrete, results revealed that using waste compact discs in concrete mixes mixture improved the workability and the dry density, as well as reducing the compressive strength of concrete containing 10% and 15 % of waste by 15% to 20 %, respectively after 28 days curing. Also, the split tensile strength values of WCDs-modified concrete mixtures were increased by 10% and 12% when the ratio of waste compact discs were 10% and 15 %, respectively after 28 days curing. On the other hand, the leaching test revealed that none of the WCDs constituents was detected in the leachant after 180 days.

The World Meteorological Organization estimates insufficiency of drinking water for over half of the world's population by 2025. Yet, the construction industry uses several billion tons of freshwater annually to wash aggregates and produce concrete. Thus, a significant step to redefine sustainability in concrete is to substitute, when possible, the use of freshwater with saltwater for concrete production. Furthermore, accelerating sustainable concrete can be achieved by considering changes in the aggregates and cement; for example recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) even when contaminated with chlorides from years of exposures, represents an ideal replacement for natural fine and coarse aggregates. More importantly, the leap to redefine sustainable concrete can happen when reconsidering the chloride content levels in cement, which will result in the ability to burn solid wastes as fuel (co-generation) and utilize byproducts of clinker production such as cement kiln dust, which is hazardous waste. This paper presents partial results of a larger study aiming at demonstrating the safe utilization of SEACON: A concrete made from seawater and/or salt-contaminated aggregates (natural or recycled) to redefine sustainability in concrete production. Evidently, due to the high chloride content of seawater and salt-contaminated aggregates, its use in reinforced concrete (RC) is prohibited by building codes due to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Redefining sustainable concrete with SEACON requires the use of alternative noncorrosive reinforcement material technologies, such as Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) bars or stainless steel. New findings validating the viability of SEACON for a sustainable concrete production when combined with noncorrosive reinforcement to construct durable and economical concrete infrastructures are presented herein. To this end, two SEACON mixes compared to a concrete mix made with traditional constituents were exposed to different environments for up to one year and evaluated through material mechanical characterization tests. Based on the initial findings, one of the SEACON mixes was selected for further validation tests, in which fresh and hardened concrete and durability properties are evaluated. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

Although state departments of transportation (DOTs) have been in the forefront of introducing recycled materials, they have not been able to clearly convey the benefits in a quantitative and transparent manner using easily understood metrics. What is lacking is direct information on sustainability assessment characteristics, i.e. greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water consumption, and waste generation. To determine the benefits of using recycled materials for DOTs, the Recycled Materials Resource Center (RMRC) is undertaking a project with the objective of providing a tool to quantitatively analyze and report the environmental and life cycle benefits of using recycled materials in highway construction. Subsequently, an analysis of the environmental benefits was conducted using PaLATE, a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool developed with RMRC sponsorship. The LCA analysis of four environmental parameters (energy use, water consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and hazardous waste generation) showed significant environmental benefits when states used recycled industrial byproducts such as fly ash and recycled roadway materials such as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP). © ASCE.",,"Asphalt pavements; Byproducts; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Geotechnical engineering; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Highway engineering; Industrial emissions; Materials handling; Recycling; Road construction; Sustainable development; Transportation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental parameter; Hazardous waste generation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Recycled asphalt pavement; Recycled concrete aggregates; State departments of transportations; Sustainability assessment; Life cycle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Primer on transportation and climate change (2008) American Association of State Highwat Abd Transportation Officials, , ftp://www.mdt.mt.gov/research/LIBRARY/PCRT-1-OL-PRIMERTRANSPORTATION-CLIMATE_CHANGE-AASHTO.PDF, AASHTO.

The toxic waste creates disposal and health hazard problems to environment and humans. Paper industry produces huge ammount of solid waste in the form of sludge. This research work deals with the sludge from paper mill and the recylcing of sludge into useful products. Paper mill sludge takes huge area for dumping the waste on the land in the form of landfill. Some paper mills incinerates the sludge by creating air pollution problems. To reduce and prevent the polltion problem by paper mill sludge, it is used for replacement of bulinding material and make waste as profitable material for construction purpose. Lime sludge from paper mill were used to produce low cost concrete by blending various ratios of cement. Experimental investigation on strength of concrete and optimum percentage of the partial replacement by replacing cement via 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of lime sludge were identified. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

Due to a relatively high level of lead, CRT funnel glass could be used as a potential material for the production of anti-radioactive concrete. In our study the CRT funnel glass , which was separated as aggregate in the concrete, was reduced to 4.75-25 mm (coarse aggregates) and less 4.75 mm (fine aggregates) in the production of anti-radioactive concrete. Mixes containing 0%, 20%, 40% , 60%, 80% and 100% (volume percentage) of CRT funnel glass to replace fine aggregate and coarse aggregate (respectively or simultaneously)) were prepared. The influence of the size, shape and replacement percentage of aggregates on workability, compressive strength and radiation shielding performance were determined. It was found that the replacement of natural aggregate with recycled CRT glass considerably improved the slump and radiation shielding performance but reduced compressive strength. The optimum percentage of waste funnel glass used as fine aggregate and coarse aggregate was 40%. The results clearly showed that the CRT funnel glass performed a significant enhancement in radiation shielding properties. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Compressive strength; CRT funnel glass; Radiation protection concrete; Shielding property","Cathode ray tubes; Cathodes; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concrete products; Energy resources; Environmental technology; Glass; Radiation shielding; Radioactivity; Recycling; Electrical equipment; Funnel glass; Hazardous solid waste; Natural aggregate; Potential materials; Radiation-protection concrete; Shielding performance; Shielding properties; Aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreola, F., Barbieri, L., Corradi, A., Lancellotti, I., Cathode ray tube glass recycling: An example of clean technology (2005) Waste Manag.

The ash comes from an incineration plant equipped with rotary and stoker furnaces, in which municipal, hospital and industrial wastes are treated. Fly ash from waste incineration is classified as hazardous and cannot be utilized or even landfilled without prior treatment. The pelletization process uses cement, lime and coal fly ash as components of the binding systems. This process has been applied to several mixes in which the ash content has been varied from 50% (wt.%) up to a maximum of 70%. An innovative additional pelletization step with only cementitious binder has been performed in order to achieve satisfactory immobilization levels. The obtained lightweight porous aggregates are mostly suitable for recovery in the field of building materials with enhanced sustainability properties. Density, water absorption and crushing strength ranged from 1000 to 1600kg/m3, 7 to 16% and 1.3 to 6.2MPa, respectively, and the second pelletization step increased stabilization efficiency. The feasibility of the process has been analyzed by testing also concrete specimens containing the artificial aggregates, resulting in lightweight concrete of average performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial aggregate concrete; Cold bonding pelletization; Double step granulation; Leaching; Municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash; Stabilization/solidification","Aggregates; Ashes; Bins; Coal ash; Concrete aggregates; Concrete testing; Concretes; Fly ash; Incineration; Industrial wastes; Leaching; Light weight concrete; Municipal solid waste; Pelletizing; Recycling; Refuse incinerators; Solid wastes; Stabilization; Waste treatment; Water absorption; Artificial aggregates; Cold bonding; Double-step; Municipal solid waste incinerator fly ashes; Stabilization/solidification; Waste incineration; cadmium; calcium oxide; cement; chloride; chromium; coal; copper; heavy metal; lead; sulfate; zinc; absorption; assessment method; concrete; fly ash; hazardous waste; immobilization; incineration; industrial waste; landfill; leaching; municipal solid waste; porous medium; recycling; solidification; stabilization; strength; sustainability; technological change; waste treatment; Article; building material; chemical composition; chemical reaction; cold; compressive strength; crushing strength; desulfurization; elasticity; fly ash; furnace; hospital waste; incineration; industrial waste; leaching; microscopy; municipal solid waste; municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash; porosity; recycling; sludge; United States; waste water management; water absorption",,"cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; chloride, 16887-00-6; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; sulfate, 14808-79-8; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baykal, G., Döven, A.G., Utilization of fly ash by pelletization process; theory: application areas and research results (2000) Resour.

Currently an enormous amount of wastewater and fresh concrete waste aggregates are being produced by the ready mix concrete industry throughout the world. The concrete washout water and excess fresh concrete aggregates are hazardous for disposal due to their high pH value (pH >12). Improper disposal of such wastewater and fresh concrete aggregates results in high environmental pollution. This study envisages an overview of the current state of knowledge about the reuse of hazardous wastewater and concrete in an environmentally acceptable manner. This study was motivated by the necessity to recycle the wastewater and fresh concrete aggregates resulting from washing out the concrete mixing trucks. Laboratory investigation was conducted and from the test results, it is identified that the performance and properties of concrete is not affected by the reuse of this hazardous wastewater and recycled aggregates.","Hazardous substance; Pollution control; Ready mix concrete; Wastewater","Concrete aggregates; Concrete industry; Concrete mixing; Construction industry; Environmental protection; Hazards; Ready mixed concrete; Wastewater; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater reclamation; Water recycling; Environmental pollutions; Environmentally acceptable; Hazardous substances; Hazardous wastewaters; Laboratory investigations; Properties of concretes; Ready mix concrete industry; Ready-mix concrete; Pollution control; concrete; hazardous waste; industrial waste; pollution control; recycling; toxicity; wastewater",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borger, J., Carrasquillo, R.L., Fowler, D.W., Use of recycled wash water and returned plastic concrete in the production of fresh concrete (1994) Advanced Cement Based Materials, L, pp. 267-274; Chatveera, B., Lertwattanaruk, P., Makul, N., Effect of sludge water from ready-mixed concrete plant on properties and durability of concrete (2006) Cement and Concrete Composites, 28, pp. 441-450; Chatveera, B., Lertwattanaruk, P., Use of ready-mixed concrete plant sludge water in concrete containing an additive or admixture (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 90, pp. 1901-1908; Chini, A.R., Muszynski, L.C., Reuse of wastewater at concrete plants in Florida in the production of fresh concrete (2001) Magazine Concrete Research, 53, pp. 311-319; Al-Ghusain, I., Mohammed Terro, J., Use of treated waste water for concrete mixing in Kuwait (2003) Kuwait Journal of Science and Engineering, 30, pp. 213-228; Low, G.L., Ng, K.Y., Ng, W.L., Tam, C.T., Heng, R.B.W., Use of recycled cement based slurry water for making concrete (2007) Journal -The Institution of Engineers, Malaysia, 68, pp. 47-55; Manzi, S., Mazzotti, C., Bignozzi, M.C., Short and long-term behavior of structural concrete with recycled concrete aggregate (2013) Cement & Concrete Composites, 37, pp. 312-318; Paolini, M., Khurana, R., Admixtures for recycling of waste concrete (1998) Cement and Concrete Composites, 20, pp. 221-229; Su, N., Miao, B., Liu, F., Effect of wash water and underground water on properties of concrete (2002) Cement Concrete Research, 32, pp. 777-782; Parker, C.L., Slimak, M.W., Waste treatment and disposal costs for the ready-mixed concrete industry (1977) The American Concrete Institute, 74 (7), pp. 281-287; Sandrolini, F., Elisa, F., Waste wash water recycling in ready mixed concrete plants (2001) Cement Concrete Research, 31, pp. 485-489; Kou, S., Poon, C., Wan, H., Properties of concrete prepared with low-grade recycled aggregates (2012) Construction and Building Materials, 36, pp. 881-889; Sheen, Y., Wang, H., Juang, Y., Le, D., Assessment on the engineering properties of ready-mixed concrete using recycled aggregates (2013) Construction and Building Materials, 45, pp. 298-305","Arunvivek, G.K.; Department of Civil Engineering, India",,,"Technoscience Publications",,,,,09726268,,,,"English","Nat.

Chromium and sulphate were identified as the most critical compounds in the leachates. To detect the sources of these two pollutant constituents in recycled aggregate, environmental assessments were performed on eight construction materials (five unused ceramic materials, two old crushed concretes and one new mortar manufactured in the laboratory). The results confirmed that leached sulphate and Cr were mainly released by the ceramic materials (bricks and tiles).To predict the toxicological consequences, the oxidation states of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) were measured in the leachates of recycled aggregates and ceramic materials classified as non-hazardous. The bricks and tiles mainly released total Cr as Cr (III). However, the recycled aggregates classified as non-hazardous according to the Landfill Directive criteria mainly released Cr (VI), which is highly leachable and extremely toxic. The obtained results highlight the need for legislation that distinguishes the oxidative state in which chromium is released into the environment. Leaching level regulations must not be based solely on total Cr, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Chromium; Construction materials; Environmental management; Leaching assessment; Sulphate","Aggregates; Brick; Building materials; Chromium; Concrete aggregates; Concrete products; Demolition; Environmental management; Hazards; Laws and legislation; Leachate treatment; Leaching; Recycling; Sulfur compounds; Construction and demolition waste; Crushed concretes; Environmental assessment; Landfill directive; Oxidation state; Recycled aggregates; Recycled materials; Sulphates; Chromium compounds; chromium; sulfate; chromium; industrial waste; sulfate; chromium; construction material; environmental assessment; environmental management; landfill; leaching; pollutant source; recycling; sulfate; testing method; toxicology; waste management; building material; ceramics; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); construction recycled material; environmental impact assessment; hazardous waste; leaching; oxidation; priority journal; recycling; Review; toxicology; analysis; building material; industrial waste; Spain; waste management; Andalucia; Spain; Chromium; Construction Materials; Industrial Waste; Recycling; Spain; Sulfates; Waste Management",,"chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; sulfate, 14808-79-8; Chromium; Industrial Waste; Sulfates",,,"European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","The authors would like to thank the ERDF of the European Union for financial support via the project “ Applications of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) for the sustainable development of road infrastructure in central area of Andalusia ” of “The 2007–2013 ERDF Operational Programme for Andalusia ”.

Application of these recycling approaches is much better and greener than conventional landfills since it can solve the problems of storage of industrial wastes and reduce exploration of natural resources for construction materials to protect the environment. Therefore, in this study, an attempt was made to recycle oil shale fly ash (OSFA), a by-product obtained from the extracting of shale oil in the oil shale industry, into a value-added glass-ceramic material via melting and sintering method. The influence of basicity (CaO/SiO2 ratio) by adding calcium oxide on the performance of glass-ceramics was studied in terms of phase transformation, mechanical properties, chemical resistances and heavy metals leaching tests. Crystallization kinetics results showed that the increase of basicity reduced the activation energies of crystallization but did not change the crystallization mechanism. When increasing the basicity from 0.2 to 0.5, the densification of sintering body was enhanced due to the promotion of viscous flow of glass powders, and therefore the compression strength and bending strength of glass-ceramics were increased. Heavy metals leaching results indicated that the produced OSFA-based glass-ceramics could be taken as non-hazardous materials. The maximum mechanical properties of compression strength of 186±3MPa, bending strength of 78±6MPa, good chemical resistances and low heavy metals leaching concentrations showed that it could be used as a substitute material for construction applications. The proposed approach will be one of the potential sustainable solutions in reducing the storage of oil shale fly ash as well as converting it into a value-added product. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Glass-ceramics; Heavy metal; Melting; Oil shale fly ash; Sintering","Activation energy; Alkalinity; Bending (forming); Bending strength; Calcium oxide; Ceramics industry; Chemical resistance; Coal ash; Coal industry; Compressive strength; Crystallization kinetics; Fly ash; Glass ceramics; Glass industry; Heavy metals; Leaching; Lime; Melting; Oil shale; Petroleum industry; Petroleum prospecting; Recycling; Sewage sludge; Sintering; Slags; Compression strength; Construction applications; Crystallization mechanisms; Leaching concentrations; Oil shale fly ash; Oil shale industry; Sustainable solution; Value added products; Oil shale processing; calcium oxide; glass; heavy metal; silicon dioxide; fly ash; Glass ceramics; ceramics; fly ash; glass; heavy metal; melting; oil shale; reaction kinetics; remediation; waste management; alkalinity; Article; biomechanics; ceramics; compressive strength; controlled study; crystallization; fly ash; leaching; oil shale; phase transition; powder; priority journal; recycling; temperature; viscosity; analysis; ceramics; chemistry; differential scanning calorimetry; fly ash; oil industry; oil spill; procedures; recycling; waste management; X ray diffraction; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Ceramics; Coal Ash; Oil and Gas Industry; Petroleum Pollution; Recycling; Waste Management; X-Ray Diffraction",,"calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Coal Ash; Glass ceramics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albertini, A.V.P., Silva, J.L., Freire, V.N., Santos, R.P., Martins, J.L., Cavada, B.S., Cadena, P.G., Lima Filho, J.L., Immobilized invertase studies on glass-ceramic support from coal fly ashes (2013) Chem.

The study was based on series of wheel tracking tests which successfully proved the possibility of mixing recycled plasterboard wastes with asphalt mixtures. The tests results showed that asphalt samples of 40% gypsum-filler ratio and asphalt samples of 40% bassanite-filler ratio as well gave the maximum resistance to plastic deformations and hence maximum dynamic stabilities. As a result, this research has shown that mixing of plasterboard wastes with asphalt concrete mixtures in specific quantities is promising. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","asphalt concretemixtures; bassanite; dynamic stability; gypsum; plasterboard wastes; rut depth; wheel tracking test","Asphalt concrete; Concrete mixing; Fillers; Gypsum; Mixing; Mixtures; Product design; Recycling; Stability; Wastes; Wheels; Bassanite; Maximum resistances; Non-toxic; Rut depth; Urban environments; Wheel tracking; Concrete mixtures",,,,,,"This work was supported by Nippo Asphalt Company/Fukuoka branch in Japan.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A., Ugai, K., Kamei, T., Application of gypsum waste plasterboard and waste plastic trays to enhance the performance of sandy soil (2010) The Proceeding of Geo-Shanghai 2010, Ground Improvement and Geosyn-thetics., 207, pp. 165-173. , Geotechnical Special Publication, ASCE The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a heterogeneous waste source used in MSWS and varies in chemical composition. Due to its nature, there is great concern about hazardous metal contamination among users of MSWS. In this study, MSWS samples were obtained weekly for 1 year from a typical incineration ash melting facility for municipal solid waste in Japan. Variation in heavy metal contents and the leachability of MSWS were investigated using two content analysis methods and two leaching tests, respectively. There is a weak correlation between metal content and concentration, and the leachability of metals in slag could not be reduced by decreasing its metal content. No measured values of hazardous metal concentration and metal content exceed the regulation levels stipulated in Japanese Industrial Standards A5031 and A5032, respectively, thereby demonstrating that the slag can be safely utilized as road and concrete aggregates. However, metal concentrations varied widely and differed by greater than 1 order of magnitude and Pb concentrations of several MSWS samples approach the regulation level. Therefore, frequent monitoring of lead leachability of MSWS and storing MSWS for several weeks to obtain a high quality that is more homogeneous in chemical composition are demanded. This study provides fundamental information for controlling the quality of MSWS and the contributing factors for achieving a safe slag recycling system. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Content analysis; Heavy metals; Leaching test; Lead; Molten slag","Concrete aggregates; Hazards; Heavy metals; Leaching; Lead; Quality control; Slags; Waste incineration; Chemical compositions; Content analysis; Content analysis method; Environmentally safe; Japanese industrial standards; Leaching test; Molten Slag; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste; lead; hazardous waste; metal; solid waste; water pollutant; chemical composition; hazardous waste; heavy metal; leaching; municipal solid waste; quality control; recycling; slag; waste facility; Article; ash; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); content analysis; controlled study; dangerous goods; incineration; Japan; leaching; melting point; municipal solid waste; municipal solid waste molten slag; pollution control; pollution monitoring; quality control; recycling; analysis; chemical model; environmental monitoring; hazardous waste; incineration; solid waste; water pollutant; Japan; Environmental Monitoring; Hazardous Waste; Incineration; Japan; Metals; Models, Chemical; Recycling; Solid Waste; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; Hazardous Waste; Metals; Solid Waste; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dijkstra, J.J., Van der Sloot, H.A., Comans, R.N., Process identification and model development of contaminant transport in MSWI bottom ash (2002) Waste Management, 22, pp. 531-541. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38XjvVelsLs%3D; Gomez, E., Rani, D.A., Cheeseman, C.R., Deegan, D., Wise, M., Boccaccini, A.R., Thermal plasma technology for the treatment of wastes: a critical review (2009) Journal of Hazardous Materials, 161, pp. 614-626. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXhsVSqtr7I; Hashimoto, K., Asami, K., Kawashima, A., Habazaki, H., Akiyama, E., The role of corrosion-resistant alloying elements in passivity (2007) Corrosion Science, 49, pp. 42-52. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28Xht1OhurrI; Huang, Y., Li, K., Effect of reducing conditions on sludge melting process (2003) Chemosphere, 50, pp. 1063-1068. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXislOrtg%3D%3D; Test methods for chemicals in slags.

In recent years, cathode ray tubes have been generated as waste owing to the introduction of newer and advanced technologies in image displays, such as liquid crystal displays and high definition televisions, among others. Generation and subsequent disposal of end-of-life cathode ray tubes presents a challenge owing to increasing volumes and high lead content embedded in the funnel and neck sections of the glass. Disposal in landfills and open dumping are anti-environmental practices considering the large-scale contamination of environmental media by the potential of toxic metals leaching from glass. Mitigating such environmental contamination will require sound management strategies that are environmentally friendly and economically feasible. This review covers existing and emerging management practices for end-of-life cathode ray tubes. An in-depth analysis of available technologies (glass smelting, detoxification of cathode ray tube glass, lead extraction from cathode ray tube glass) revealed that most of the techniques are environmentally friendly, but are largely confined to either laboratory scale, or are often limited owing to high cost to mount, or generate secondary pollutants, while a closed-looped method is antiquated. However, recycling in cementitious systems (cement mortar and concrete) gives an added advantage in terms of quantity of recyclable cathode ray tube glass at a given time, with minimal environmental and economic implications. With significant quantity of waste cathode ray tube glass being generated globally, cementitious systems could be economically and environmentally acceptable as a sound management practice for cathode ray tube glass, where other technologies may not be applicable. © The Author(s) 2015.","Cathode ray tube glass; cementitious systems; environmental contamination; recycling; sound management practice","Cathode ray tubes; Cathode rays; Contamination; Detoxification; Digital television; Electronic Waste; Environmental management; Glass; High definition television; Lead smelting; Liquid crystal displays; Liquid crystals; Recycling; Tubes (components); Best available technologies; Cementitious systems; Disposal in landfills; Economic implications; Environmental contamination; Environmental practices; Environmentally acceptable; Sound management; Cathodes; alkali; cement; chloride; concrete; lead; silicon dioxide; glass; electrode; electronic equipment; feasibility study; glass; landfill; leaching; management practice; recycling; technological development; waste disposal; waste management; Article; cathode ray tube; chemical reaction; cost; detoxification; environmental economics; glass industry; heavy metal removal; human; hydrometallurgy; investigative procedures; law enforcement; leaching; mechanical activation; metal recovery; metallurgy; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; recycling; smelting; technology; volatilization; waste component removal; waste disposal; analysis; electronic waste; waste management; Cathode Ray Tube; Electronic Waste; Glass; Recycling; Waste Management",,"chloride, 16887-00-6; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrade, F.R.D., Maringolo, V., Kihara, Y., Incorporation of V, Zn and Pb into the crystalline phases of portland clinker (2003) Cement & Concrete Research, 33, pp. 63-71; Andreola, F., Barbieri, L., Corradi, A., Cathode ray tube glass recycling: An example of clean technology (2005) Waste Management & Research, 23, pp. 314-321; Andreola, F., Barbieri, L., Corradi, A., Lancelotti, I., CRT glass state of the art.

This paper attempts to explore the feasibility of reutilizing textile effluent sludge (TES) for producing concrete blocks with a pretreatment step. The lime-based pretreatment process was adopted to remove ammonia in TES which had been found to lead to bad odor and strength loss of the concrete blocks. The concrete blocks were prepared with an aggregate to cement ratio of 12, 10 and 6. The pretreated TES was adopted to replace the fine aggregate at a mass ratio ranging from 0% to 30%. The compressive strength and drying shrinkage values were determined to evaluate the performance of concrete blocks containing TES. The results indicated that the lime-based pretreatment process can lower the ammonia concentration in TES significantly. The concrete blocks with a lower TES content and lower ammonia concentration had higher compressive strength and better volume stability. When the TES content in the concrete blocks was about 10%, the concrete blocks with an aggregate to cement ratio of 10 can satisfy the minimum strength requirement for non-load bearing applications. Meanwhile, the result of leaching test indicated that the toxic trace metals present in textile effluent sludge could be stabilized/solidified and metal leaching from the concrete blocks is not a concern. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonia; Concrete block; Leaching; Lime-based pretreatment; Textile effluent sludge","Aggregates; Ammonia; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Effluents; Industrial research; Industrial wastes; Leaching; Lime; Shrinkage; Textiles; Trace elements; Ammonia concentrations; Drying shrinkages; Non-load bearings; Pre-Treatment; Pretreatment process; Textile effluent; Toxic trace metals; Volume stability; Concrete blocks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balasubramanian, J., Sabumon, P.C., Lazar, J.U., Ilangovan, R., Reuse of textile effluent treatment plant sludge in building materials (2006) Waste Manag., 1, pp. 22-28; Batchelor, B., Overview of waste stabilization with cement (2006) Waste Manag., 7, pp. 689-698; BSI, (2008) BSI BS 6073-2: Precast Concrete Masonry Units - Part 2: Guide for Specifying Precast Concrete Masonry Units; BSI, (2009) BS EN 12390-3: Testing Hardened Concrete Part 3: Compressive Strength of Test Specimens; Francisco, B., Pedro, G., Jordi, P., José, M.S., Portland cement systems with addition of sewage sludge ash.

In light of using such a nondegradable, hazardous waste effectively, this study was carried out using the recycled computer plastic waste as coarse aggregate in concrete. The computer plastic waste was collected and made into chips, which predominantly have high impact polystyrene (HIPS). The coarse aggregate was partially replaced with HIPS by volume percentages of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% for different water-cement ratios such as 0.53, 0.49, and 0.45. A total of 486 concrete specimens were cast to investigate the effect of HIPS and water- cement ratio on the fresh and hardened properties of concrete. The concrete specimens were tested under compression, tension, and flexure on the 7th and 28th day. The engineering properties such as workability, compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength, and elastic modulus of concrete were obtained experimentally and were compared with the control concrete. From the experimental results, concrete specimens made using HIPS aggregate were found to be capable of retaining 50% strength under all of the test conditions, when 50% coarse aggregates are replaced by HIPS aggregate. Various volume percentages of HIPS aggregate replacement show a linear relation between the loss of strength and increase in HIPS content. Because the reduction in strength was observed, this type of concrete can be used in nonstructural elements such as partition walls and lightweight roofs. The addition of HIPS aggregate in concrete reduces the unit weight of concrete; it can be used in earthquake-prone areas where the reduction in mass is essential. Hence, the effective use of HIPS as a coarse aggregate substitute in concrete is one of the feasible solutions for the solid waste management problem and thereby reduces environmental pollution and conserves the natural resources from depletion. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Coarse aggregate; Computer; Concrete; Electronic waste; Hazardous waste; High-impact polystyrene; Plastic","Cements; Compressive strength; Computers; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Mechanical properties; Natural resources management; Plastics; Polystyrenes; Recycling; Tensile strength; Waste management; Wastes; Coarse aggregates; Electronic waste; Environmental pollutions; Fresh and hardened properties; Hazardous wastes; High impact polystyrene; Non-structural elements; Split tensile strengths; Aggregates; aggregate; concrete; electronic equipment; hazardous waste; plastic; recycling; solid waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmadinia, E., Zargar, M., Karim, M.R., Abdelaziz, M., Shafigh, P., Using waste plastic bottles as additive for stone mastic asphalt (2011) Mater.

RCA used in road layers is submitted to intermittent leaching. The leachant neutralizes the alkali of the RCA and the leaching intermission promotes the carbonation of the RCA's residual mortar. Both processes introduce acid to the RCA, releasing the pH-dependent toxic constituents of the RCA to the local aquifer. In this study, the acid intake caused by the leachant renewal and leachate decantation is calculated and compared with the acid intake induced by the carbonation during the leaching intermission. It is found that carbonation dominates the acid intake of the leached RCA layer while the renewal-decantation process acts only secondary role. The use of open-graded RCA base overlain by a dense pavement is recommended to reduce the carbonation rate of the RCA and to retard the leaching pH-dependent toxic elements to the local aquifer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The utilisation of these resources ideally enables natural resources to be saved. However, the quality of the recovered scrap metals may limit recycling potential, and the utilisation of aggregates may cause the release of toxic substances into the natural environment through leaching. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to a full-scale MSWI bottom ash management and recovery system to identify environmental breakeven points beyond which the burdens of the recovery processes outweigh the environmental benefits from valorising metals and mineral aggregates. Experimental data for the quantity and quality of individual material fractions were used as a basis for LCA modelling. For the aggregates, three disposal routes were compared: landfilling, road sub-base and aggregate in concrete, while specific leaching data were used as the basis for evaluating toxic impacts. The recovery and recycling of aluminium, ferrous, stainless steel and copper scrap were considered, and the importance of aluminium scrap quality, choice of marginal energy technologies and substitution rates between primary and secondary aluminium, stainless steel and ferrous products, were assessed and discussed. The modelling resulted in burdens to toxic impacts associated with metal recycling and leaching from aggregates during utilisation, while large savings were obtained in terms of non-toxic impacts. However, by varying the substitution rate for aluminium recycling between 0.35 and 0.05 (on the basis of aluminium scrap and secondary aluminium alloy market value), it was found that the current recovery system might reach a breakeven point between the benefits of recycling and energy expended on sorting and upgrading the scrap. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aluminum recycling; Bottom ash; LCA; Metals leaching; MSWI; Scrap metal recovery","aluminum; concrete; copper; iron; stainless steel; metal; pollutant; aluminum; bottom ash; incineration; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; recycling; Article; bottom ash; energy expenditure; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; human; incineration; landfill; leaching; life cycle assessment; metal recovery; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste disposal; waste-to-energy; analysis; energy conservation; pollutant; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environmental Pollutants; Incineration; Metals; Recycling",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; stainless steel, 12597-68-1; Environmental Pollutants; Metals",,,,"This research was funded partially by AFATEK Ltd . and by the Danish Research Council as a part of the IRMAR (Integrated Resource Management & Recovery) initiative ( nr. 11-116775 ).

Buffer Basin is an open concrete basin connected to downstream of API Separator (integrated system in New Oily Water Treatment/NOWT, Senipah Terminal). Originally, Buffer Basin was designed to handle fluctuation/excessive flow of incoming oily water from process (e.g. from separator and storage tank draining). The biggest impact of isolating buffer basin is stopping liquid production of all TEPI sites. This generates long discussion and trial before the implementation. Consequently, accumulations of sludge/sand were affecting not only the quality of the discharged produced water but also the health of people/personnel due to the massive generation of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene, and Xylene). The key factor of Buffer Basin cleaning was the successful re-activation of old OWTU to temporarily bypass the incoming oily water treatment. During this temporary period, no process shutdown was experienced which may impact occurrence of production loss. The oily water treatment operating cost was reduced by approximately 50% due to reduction on chemical injection. The quality of disposed water to environment is still below permit requirement. Meanwhile, cleaning the Buffer Basin itself was challenging due to huge amount and various properties of sludge/solid, highly impacted by weather, hazardous material exposure, etc. The sludge was treated using Sludge Oil Recovery (SOR) process resulting in 4 derivatives/products (recovered oil, solid, emulsion, and oily water). To comply with environment regulation, upon relevant Government Bodies approval, TEPI in cooperation with licensed Contractor used 3R (Reduced, Reuse, Recycle) approach to manage the waste. The solid waste was processed to become fire resistant bricks which can later on be used as heat insulation. The emulsion was used as synthetic fuel and become energy source for making the bricks. The water was treated in oily water treatment unit prior disposal to environment. Recovered oil was sent back to TEPI's storage tank. The project was completed and all the challenges were overcome.

Alumina waste was obtained from aluminium thermal metallurgy industry, silica waste was obtained from silicone recycle industry in Thailand. This present study aimed at investigating the basic physical and chemical properties of waste materials and also the optimal proportion in geopolymer production. The results revealed that alumina waste contained 48 percent of aluminium oxide, 4.18 percent of Silicon dioxide and average particle size is 36 micrometers. Silica waste contained 71.3 percent of Silicon dioxide and average particle size is 49 micrometers. The leaching tests of heavy metals also indicated that the level of all heavy metals concentration were over the standard set by the Ministry of Industry, Thailand which means both alumina and silica waste were considering as hazardous waste. In geopolymer production, the mortar was cast in 5×5×5 centimeters cubic shape for both methods with cured temperature at 60 degree celsius. Compressive strength was tested at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. The results revealed that the best SiO2:Al2O3 ratio must be 3:1 mixed by alumina waste 46 g. and silica waste 24 g. with 10 ml of sodium hydroxide and 20 ml of sodium silicate. This proportion gain the highest compressive strength for 262.8 kg/cm2 at 28 days of curing which over the sta nd ard for hollow loa d-bearing concrete ma sonry units (TIS57-2530) and costs 4.03 THB/mortar. The leaching tests were estimated again after the production of geopolymer. The results indicated that the concentration of all heavy metals were within the standard set by the Ministry of Industry, Thailand. Therefore the production of geopolymer mortar from alumina waste and silica waste were not considering as hazardous waste.","Alumina waste; Geopolymer; Silica waste; Waste utilization","Alumina; Aluminum; Compressive strength; Curing; Geopolymers; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Heavy metals; Inorganic polymers; Leaching; Micrometers; Mortar; Particle size; Recycling; Silicates; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Silicones; Sodium; Waste utilization; Average particle size; Geopolymer; Geopolymer mortars; Metallurgy industry; Metals concentrations; Physical and chemical properties; Silica waste; Sodium hydroxides; Silica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ferdinandez-Jimenez, A., Palomo, A., Characterisation of fly ashes.

Moreover we want to encourage the government to find solutions regarding the disposal to landfills of glassy waste materials and provide new knowledge to the contractors and developers on how to improve the construction industry methods and services by using glassy waste to sustain good product performance and meet recycling goals. Different kinds of glass wastes in the form of sub grain packaging glass cullet, CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) panel glass waste and calsi glass, were used as a sand replacement in AAC production. Large proportion of the post-consumer glass is recycled into the packaging stream again, but some sub grain packaging glass cullet does not meet the strict criteria for packaging glass thus is sent to landfill. CRT is classified as a hazardous glass waste and there are several issues surround CRTs which create barriers to increased recovery of the glass. In countries e.g. Latin America and Asia where still CRT glass is being produced even when shredder, the glass stream is a mixture of panel and funnel glass, making it difficult for reuse in new CRTs. Based on our knowledge also calsi glass as a processed blast furnace slag is not used in packaging production. The viability of current and novel applications of mentioned glasses is examined here. Although aerated concrete was initially envisaged as a good insulation material, there has been renewed interest in its structural characteristics in view of its lighter weight, savings in material and potential for large scale utilization of wastes. Due to this fact we undertake the studies of an influence of different amounts of glass wastes onto properties of aerated concrete in terms of physical (microstructure, density), mechanical (compressive and tensile strengths) and chemical characteristic. Use of milled waste glass in concrete as partial re-placement of sand represents an important step towards development of sustainable (environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and economic concrete-based infrastructure systems. © 2015 The Authors.

This poses a serious ecological threat as the tires contain many toxic components and contribute to a loss of biodiversity. From the economic and environmental perspectives, inclusion of recycled rubber in concrete would reduce costs as well as conserve the component materials used in concrete. Past studies have indicated poormechanical properties of concrete with the sole inclusion of recycled tire rubber. This paper presents an experimental investigation to improve the workability and hardened properties through sodium hydroxide surface treatment of recycled crumb rubber, and silica fume. Ten concrete mixes were prepared with the volumes of recycled rubber ranging from 10% to 30%. The test results were compared with a control concrete mix. The investigation indicated that favorable strength could be achieved with the addition of 10% treated rubber. Test results and analysis details are presented in the paper.

Two types of spent catalyst; equilibrium catalyst (ECat) and zeolite catalyst (ZCat) were used to partially replace some selected sizes of aggregate in the HMA. Chemical analysis of the raw catalysts indicated that both catalyst types used in this study comprised mainly of Al2O3 and SiO2. Marshall Method of mix design was followed to determine the optimum asphalt content of the aggregate structure containing waste catalyst. Volumetric and stability data indicated that there is a good potential for using spent catalyst in road applications. Environmental analysis and moisture damage potential were also carried out to further characterize the designed mixes. It was observed that the level of all toxic elements in both ECat and ZCat spent catalysts samples were within the acceptable limits. ECat mixes proved to be less susceptible to moisture damage compared to the ZCat mixes. For the amounts of catalyst used in this study, the ZCat mixes failed to meet the moisture resistance requirements of 80% retained strength and hence it is not recommended to be utilized as a filler material. © Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.","Asphalt mixes; Moisture susceptibility; Waste catalyst in roads; Waste recycling","Aggregates; Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Catalysts; Chemical analysis; Crude oil; Moisture; Aggregate structures; Asphalt mix; Constituent materials; Environmental analysis; Moisture resistance; Moisture susceptibility; Waste catalysts; Waste recycling; Asphalt concrete",,,,,"CR/ENG/CIVL/09/01",,,,,,,,,,,"Antiohos, S.K., Chouliara, E., Tsimas, S., Reuse of spent catalyst from oil-cracking refineries as supplementary cementing material (2006) China Particuology, 4 (2), pp. 73-76; Furimsky, E., Spent refinery catalysts: Environment, safety and utilization (1996) Catalysis Today, 30, pp. 223-286; User’s Guide to Hazardous Waste Classification (1993) Export and Import of Hazardous Waste Regulations, , Environment Canada, 2nd Edition, Government of Canada, Canada; Su, N., Fang, H.Y., Chen, Z.H., Liu, F.S., Reuse of waste catalysts from petrochemical industries for cement substitution (2000) Cement and Concrete Research, 30, pp. 1773-1783; Su, N., Chen, Z.H., Fang, H.Y., Reuse of spent catalyst as fine aggregate in cement mortar (2001) Cement & Concrete Composites, 23, pp. 111-118; Rattanasak, U., Jaturapitakkul, C., Sudaprasert, T., Compressive strength and heavy metal leaching behavior of mortars containing spent catalyst (2001) Waste Management & Research, 19, pp. 456-464; Paya, J., Monzo, J., Borrachero, M.V., Physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC3R) blended cements (2001) Cement and Concrete Research, 31, pp. 57-61; Pacewskaa, B., Bukowska, M., Wiliňskaa, I., Swat, M., Modification of the properties of concrete by a new pozzolan.

Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) are the video display components of televisions and computer monitors (EPA, 1995). Arising problem related with recovery and recycling of CRT glass stimulates examinations aimed at making cullet-based ceramic materials of reinforced mechanical strength. Glasses as cone and neck contain principally different lead contents another dangerous elements instead panel glass has other heavy metals (Ba, Sr, etc.) that forbid their recycling in the glass industry for the production of containers, domestic glassware and glass fiber. As it is well known concrete is an excellent material for immobilization of these metals, what was the reason to undertake this research. The use of CRT (Cathode Ray tube) waste glasses in concrete has attracted a lot of interest worldwide due to the increased disposal costs and environmental concerns. Because of silica large quantities CRT glass in the theory is a pozzolanic in nature, thus it can be used as a sand replacement in light concrete. The research was performed with use of concrete mortars. As a reference concrete mortar a mix of cement, sand, expanded clay aggregate and water was used. The purpose of this work was to investigate the influence of additives e.g. CRT glass cullet as an aggregate, and fluidized fly ash on concrete properties. Based on obtained results both CRT glass cullet and fluidize fly ash improved compressive and flexural strength in respect of standard concrete mortar without these additives. The use of CRT glass as a sand replacement caused the increased of compressive strength of concrete mortar of about 16% and its flexural strength of about 14%. © 2015 The Authors.

About 4500 tons of this hazardous waste material was obtained during the reconstruction of the runway at Ljubljana Airport. According to the first scenario, this material could be transported to a suitable incineration plant where the hazardous compounds would be decomposed. According to the second scenario, it could be treated as a recycled aggregate, and used for the production of lean concrete for different civil engineering applications, in which case 40 wt. % of the natural aggregates would be replaced by reclaimed asphalt. The hazardous PAHs would be immobilised in the concrete. The results of LCA analysis showed that the incineration scenario has an especially significant impact on energy consumption, as well as on Abiotic Depletion Potential and Global Warming Potential. The reason for this can be found in the energy needs at the incineration plant for the maintenance of high combustion temperatures, since the net generation of energy is low during the incineration of low calorific reclaimed asphalt. In the case of the recycling scenario, the results of the study showed only a slight burden or even a benefit for all of the studied environmental indicators. This is a direct consequence of the reduced extraction and production of natural aggregate. The study also showed that around 1.5-2 EUR can be saved for each ton of reclaimed asphalt in the case of recycling scenario.© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The recycled CRT funnel glass used had been acid treated and regarded as a non hazardous material based on the regulatory thresholds of the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). Two series of concrete paving blocks were prepared, one with and one without the use of coarse aggregate. Additionally, TiO2, a photo-catalyst was added to the surface layer of the blocks during the fabrication process to effect photo-catalytic reaction for the removal of an air pollutant, nitrogen oxide (NO). For each series, the CRT glass was used to replace the fine aggregate by volume at different ratios. Their physical, mechanical and durability properties, lead leachability, and photocatalytic air purifier performance were studied. The results show that the use of up to 100% CRT funnel glass as fine aggregate in concrete paving blocks not only have satisfactory levels in compressive strength (&gt;45 MPa) and ASR expansion (&lt;0.1%), but improved the resistance to water absorption, drying shrinkage and photocatalytic performance for reducing air pollutants. However, the TCLP results reveal that the casting method of producing dry-mixed concrete blocks had a significant influence on lead leaching, and the replacement ratio of the CRT glass should be limited to about 25%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Concrete paving blocks; CRT funnel glass; Dry-mix casting method; Leaching of lead; Properties","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Catalysis; Cathode ray tubes; Compressive strength; Concrete blocks; Concrete mixers; Glass; Hazardous materials; Leaching; Nitrogen oxides; Recycling; Casting method; Concrete paving blocks; Funnel glass; Mechanical and durability properties; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic reactions; Properties; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedures; Aggregates",,,,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Environment and Conservation Fund, ECF","The authors would like to thank the Environment and Conservation Fund and the Woo Wheelock Greed Fund , and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for funding support.",,,,,,,,,,"(2007) Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-bar Method), , ASTM International USA Astm C 1260; (2008) Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Hydraulic-cement Mortars, , ASTM International USA Astm C349; (2006) Standard Test Method for Density, Absorption, and Voids in Hardened Concrete, , ASTM International USA Astm C642; (1981) Precast Concrete Masonry Units, Specification for Precast Concrete Masonry Units, , British Standards Institution UK Bs 6073-Part 1; Castro, S.D., Brito, J.D., Evaluation of the durability of concrete made with crushed glass aggregates (2013) J.

A recycling process has been developed by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, to turn hazardous CRT waste glass into valuable resources (e.g. treated funnel glass (TFG)). However, finding a beneficial use for the recycled TFG remains an issue for the local waste management industry. In this study, the use of TFG to replace recycled fine concrete aggregates in concrete blocks prepared with different aggregate-to-cement (A/C) ratios was investigated. The experimental results show that the impermeable nature of TFG made concrete blocks more resistant to water penetration and have lower drying shrinkage. The use of TFG also increased the block density and improved the X-ray radiation–shielding performance. All the blocks demonstrated acceptable compressive strength and alkali-silica reaction behaviour, and a lower A/C ratio could maintain a better alkaline environment and stronger cement matrix structure to stabilize and solidify the TFG in the blocks to prevent lead leaching. On the basis of the findings, the authors concluded that it is feasible to utilize high per cent of TFG in concrete blocks if a proper A/C ratio and appropriate casting method are used. © 2014, ICE Publishing.

It is also known as bitumen which may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; classed as a pitch. Earlier reports show that most natural bitumen contains sulphur and several heavy metals, such as nickel, vanadium, lead, chromium, mercury, arsenic, selenium, and other toxic elements. The primary use of asphalt/bitumen is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete. Many studies demonstrated microbial utilization of asphalt and related hydrocarbons, particularly the petroleum hydrocarbons. Investigation was carried out to isolate and characterize microorganisms and determine their heavy metal tolerance activity from such kind of ponds in which the pitch waste effluent was released. Later, it was checked whether they have any role in the modification of asphalt texture. Experiments were executed by first determining the physical and chemical characteristics (flame test) of the pitch effluent, then isolating the microorganisms from it and found Gram positive Coccus. Flame test revealed the presence of arsenic (As) and lead (Pb). Then, it was checked whether the isolated microorganisms are tolerant to these heavy metals. Later, the use of these heavy metals by the isolated microorganisms was detected by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric study. The pattern of growth indicated it to be Staphylococcus sp., and when incubated with asphalt, it not only utilizes the hydrocarbon, but also prevents it from hardening. Thus, a pathogenic bacteria can be utilized in recycling of complex hydrocarbon and it continue to sustain itself for a prolong period even in the absence of suitable substrate.","Asphalt; Heavy metals; Hydrocarbons; Tolerant bacteria","Arsenic; Asphalt; Asphalt concrete; Concrete aggregates; Effluents; Flame hardening; Gasoline; Heavy metals; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Sewage; Textures; Gram-positive cocci; Heavy metal tolerance; Isolated microorganisms; Metal-tolerant bacteria; Pathogenic bacterium; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Physical and chemical characteristics; Spectrophotometric study; Bacteria; asphalt; bacterium; concrete; effluent; growth rate; heavy metal; hydrocarbon; microbial activity; physicochemical property; recycling; sulfur; tolerance; Bacteria (microorganisms); Posibacteria; Staphylococcus sp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CIS, Metals (1999) Basics of Chemical Safety and Health Information Centre (CIS), , International Labour Organisation, Geneva; Ferguson, C., Kern, M., Audesirk, G., Nanomolar concentrations of inorganic lead increase ca2+ efflux and decrease intracellular free ca2+ ion concentrations in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by a calmodulin dependent mechanism (2000) Neurotoxicology, 21, pp. 365-378; Harris, J.O., Kline, R.M., Crumpton, C.F., A study of the presence of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria at the soil-asphalt interface of kansas highways (1956) Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science, 1903, pp. 495-499; Balcom, I.N., Crowley, D.E., Microbial diversity of asphalt-soil mixtures in the rancho la brea asphalt seeps (2010) International Journal of Phytoremediation, 12 (6), pp. 599-615; John, O.H., (1990) Introduction to Asphalt, pp. 45-91. , 8th Edition.

Replete with energy-intensive equipment, significant waste production, and multiple toxic chemicals, ICUs contribute to environmental harm and may inadvertently have a negative impact on the health of patients, staff, and visitors. This article evaluates the ICU on four areas of environmental sustainability: energy, waste, toxic chemicals, and healing environment and provides concrete actions ICU nurses can take to decrease environmental health risks in the ICU.

The waste generated after the casting process is called waste foundry sand (WFS). Depending on the mold composition and the casting process, WFS can contain substances that prevent its direct emission to the environment. In Brazil, this waste is classified according to the Standard ABNT NBR 10004:2004 as a waste Class II (Non-Inert). The recycling of this waste is limited because its characteristics change significantly after use. Although the use (or reuse) of this byproduct in civil construction is a technically feasible alternative, its effects must be evaluated, especially from mechanical and environmental points of view. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the use of WFS in the manufacture of cement artifacts, such as masonry blocks for walls, structural masonry blocks, and paving blocks. Blocks containing different concentrations of WFS (up to 75% by weight) were produced and evaluated using compressive strength tests (35. MPa at 28. days) and toxicity tests on Daphnia magna, Allium cepa (onion root), and Eisenia foetida (earthworm). The results showed that there was not a considerable reduction in the compressive strength, with values of 35. ±. 2. MPa at 28. days. The toxicity study with the material obtained from leaching did not significantly interfere with the development of D. magna and E. foetida, but the growth of the A. cepa species was reduced. The study showed that the use of this waste in the production of concrete blocks is feasible from both mechanical and environmental points of view. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Concrete blocks; Foundry sand; Mechanical properties; Toxicity; Waste","Cement industry; Compressive strength; Concrete blocks; Concrete industry; Foundries; Mechanical properties; Molds; Phenolic resins; Toxicity; Wastes; Casting process; Civil constructions; Direct emissions; Eisenia foetida; Feasible alternatives; Structural masonry; Toxicological evaluation; Waste foundry sands; Foundry sand; concrete; industrial toxic substance; alloy; industrial waste; metal; organic compound; phenol; silicon dioxide; soil; compressive strength; concentration (composition); concrete; mechanical property; phenolic compound; pollutant; resin; standard (reference); toxicity; toxicology; animal experiment; article; cement industry; chemical analysis; chemical composition; compressive strength; controlled study; Daphnia magna; Eisenia fetida; feasibility study; growth inhibition; materials testing; nonhuman; onion; plant growth; plant root; priority journal; recycling; toxicity testing; waste; waste foundry sand; analysis; animal; building material; chemistry; Daphnia; environmental protection; industrial waste; infrared spectroscopy; mechanical stress; Oligochaeta; particle size; pressure; procedures; soil; time; waste disposal; Brazil; Allium cepa; Daphnia magna; Eisenia fetida; Alloys; Animals; Compressive Strength; Conservation of Natural Resources; Construction Materials; Daphnia; Industrial Waste; Metals; Oligochaeta; Onions; Organic Chemicals; Particle Size; Phenol; Plant Roots; Pressure; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Silicon Dioxide; Soil; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Stress, Mechanical; Time Factors; Toxicity Tests",,"phenol, 108-95-2, 3229-70-7; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Alloys; Industrial Waste; Metals; Organic Chemicals; Phenol; Silicon Dioxide; Soil",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","The authors are grateful to the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq/Brazil) for funding this work.",,,,,,,,,,"Dean, A., Voss, D., (1999) Design and Analysis of Experiments, p. 740. , Springer, USA; Días, O'R.V., (1998) Método de Dosagem de Concreto de Elevado Desempenho, p. 122. , São Paulo, PINI; Fiskesjo, G., The Allium test as a standard in environmental monitoring (1985) Hereditas, 102, pp. 99-112; Hammer, Ø., Harper, D.A.T., Ryan, P.D., PAST: paleontological statistics software package for education and data analysis (2001) Palaeontol.

The free calcium oxide (CaOfree) present in the HCFA complicates the work of the ash-handling system and increases the risk of allocation of alkaline effluent from the dumps. Disposal of a dry selection HCFA in the production of construction materials is problematic as hardening of the ash stone often results in extension. To reduce the environmental risks in the TPP and increase recycling of HCFA a preliminary its (HCFA) granulation is suggested instead of the traditional hydraulic ash removal system. The methods of HCFA granulation were investigated by using waste products of Kansk-Achinsk coal. Granular ashes, depending on the CaOfree content are suggested to use for the replacement of natural aggregates for concrete, to obtain cement clinker by means of high-speed firing of granules in a sintering machine as active mineral additives for mixed binding materials. © 2014 WIT Press.","Aggregates; Cement clinker; Concrete; Free calcium oxide; Granular ashes; Granulation; High calcium fly ash","aggregate; cement; concrete; construction material; effluent; environmental risk; fly ash; granular medium; lime; power plant; thermal power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vishnya, V.L., Volkova, R.N., Viner, A.N., Uphimtsev, V.M., (1983) Bulletin of Inventions, , Author's Certificate (Pat) No. 998818 (USSR) System of high-calcium ash slags remoxal, Published 25 Feb; Domanskaya, I.K., Oleinik, V.N., High-calcium fly ash: Forming of composition and hydraulic activity (2006) Internationale Baustofftagung.- Weimar, pp. 1071-1079. , Ibausil 16; Domanskaya, I.K., Oleinik, V.N., Phase composition and mechanism of hardening of high-calcium fly-ash (2009) Internationale Baustofftagung.- Weimar, pp. 0817-0822. , Ibausil 17; Uphimtsev, V.M., Domanskaya, I.K., Yaroslavtseva, R.V., (1991) Method of Obtaining Unburnt Gravel Made of High-calcium Ashes, , Author's Certificate No.1691345 (USSR), Published 15 Nov; Domanskaya, I.K., Oleinik, V.N., Physico-chemical features of the artificial aggregate production on the basis of high-calcium fly ashes (2012) Internationale Baustofftagung.

Recycling or reuse of solid waste is desirable to reduce the adverse impact of this material. The vast annual production of printed circuit board (PCB) waste in Taiwan creates environmental concerns because of the leaching of toxic chemicals into landfills. This study assessed the feasibility of utilizing resin powder and glass fiber recycled from PCB waste as a partial replacement of fine aggregate (natural river sand) in concrete. It also established a comprehensive test program to promote the use of recycling waste for waste reduction. The crushed powder of PCB mixed with standard mortar in fixed volumetric mix proportion, as sand:cement:water=2.75:1: 0.485 was the control group to test the fresh and hardened properties of the material. The test results of hardened specimen properties showed that the addition of PCB resin powder should be less than 10 %, and the addition level of glass fiber should be less than 2 %. The engineering properties and durability matched those of the cement mortar of the standard control group. Because toxic chemicals released from PCB powder and hardened concretes were found to be less than the tolerance limit in the local ordinances, waste PCB can be used in cement mortar, providing an alternative for recycling industrial waste PCB.

They are classified as a specified item and disposed of as waste. The national guidelines stipulate that the tsunami deposits that meet all the requirements (e.g. requirements for separation and disposal and freedom from toxic materials) and have been identified by prefectural or municipal governments should not be classified as waste. Under the circumstances, tests were conducted concerning the applicability of the rotary crushing and mixing method (NETIS KT-090048-V) that had been adopted for soil improvement for the purpose of expanding the use of the method for separating and disposing of tsunami deposits and modifying the separated deposits into recycled materials for use in public works. Separating tsunami deposits that are in the form of soil mass using solely vibrating sieves is extremely difficult. It was found that deposits could be separated much better by crushing and grinding soil masses using rotary crushing and mixing machines. It was also became clear that making an effective use of concrete produced as disaster waste or crushing and mixing tsunami deposits using quicklime as an additive was highly effective for separating and disposing of deposits. As a result of adding concrete waste or quicklime for separating and mixing deposits, separation and mixing were improved and the trafficability was enhanced owing to the improvement of separated soils. The soils modified using the rotary crushing and mixing method were considered applicable as recycled fill materials. Thus, using the rotary crushing and mixing method enables the separation of tsunami deposits, which are generally disposed of as waste unless modified, into waste and deposits and the use of separated deposits as recycled materials. Removing the deposits attached to waste as much as possible is expected to contribute to the reduction of the quantity of waste that needs to be treated at disposal sites. Disaster waste will be disposed of at high speed in the affected areas. We propose the rotary crushing and mixing method as a useful method that can meet diverse requirements. © 2014 The Society of Materials Science.","Recycling; Soil improvement; The rotary crushing and mixing method; Tsunami deposit; Waste separation","Disaster wastes; Great east japan earthquakes; Mixing method; Municipal government; Recycled materials; Soil improvement; Tsunami deposits; Waste separation; Concrete mixing; Concretes; Crushing; Disasters; Lime; Recycling; Separation; Soils; Toxic materials; Tsunamis; Waste disposal; Deposits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Guidelines (Master Plan) for Disposing of Disaster Waste Produced during the Great East Japan Earthquake, , Ministry of the Environment; (2012) Technical Guidelines for Improving Parks and Green Space As Part of the Reconstruction in the Wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake, , Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism; (2012) Use of Materials Recycled from Disaster Waste in Public Works for the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in the Wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake (Notice), , Ministry of the Environment; Nakajima, N., Yoshizawa, H., Mizuno, S., Characteristics of grading of fill dam materials produced using rotary crushers (2001) Paper Presented at the 28th Meeting of the Kanto Branch of Japan Society of Civil Engineers, pp. 812-813; (2009) Manual for River Earthwork, , Japan Institute of Country-ology and Engineering; (2000) Fill Design and Construction Manual for High-standard Embankments, , Foundation of Riverfront Improvement and Restoration","Japan Development and Construction Co., Ltd, Aiko-gun, Kanagawa, 243-0303, Japan",,,,,,,,05145163,,ZARYA,,"Japanese","Zairyo",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892904042

In the long-term, the Pb release is efficiently controlled by the precipitation of cerussite (PbCO3), Pb-phosphates and anglesite (PbSO4) and by sorption onto newly formed hydrous ferric oxides. In contrast, Zn is the most important contaminant that is continuously released from the primary slag and, after leaching for 12years, its concentration exceeds more than 40× the regulatory limit value for hazardous wastes (200mg/kg). For this reason, the recycling of primary slag for civil engineering purposes (concrete technology, gravel-like material) cannot be recommended, because of the long-term Zn leaching. In terms of the leaching of metals (Pb, Zn, Cu) and metalloids (As, Sb), the secondary slag mostly fulfils the limit criteria for inert waste according to the EU legislation even for long-term leaching. However, high release of Ba exceeding more than 10× the limit values for hazardous waste was observed, despite the massive formation of barite (BaSO4) on the slag surface. These results indicate that less common contaminants (e.g. Ba), which have been overlooked so far, should also be considered during assessment of the leaching behaviour of smelting slags with a view to their safe recycling in civil engineering. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Battery recycling; Concrete technology; Hazardous wastes; Hydrous ferric oxides; Leaching behaviours; Long-term leaching; Metallurgical technologies; Regulatory limit; Civil engineering; Copper; Hazardous materials; Impurities; Laws and legislation; Leaching; Lead; Recycling; Zinc; Slags; assessment method; barite; civil engineering; data set; European Union; hazardous waste; leaching; lead; legislative implementation; mineralogy; oxide; phosphate; pollution effect; recycling; slag; sorption",,,,,"Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT: MSM 0021620855; Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR: 13-17501S","This study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GAČR No. 13-17501S).

Some effects are harmful; others welcome. Many depend on circumstances. A major component of concrete is cement, which has its own environmental and social impacts and contributes largely to those of concrete. In spite of the harm that badly planned use of concrete can do, well-planned concrete construction can have many benefits. The cement industry is one of the primary producers of carbon dioxide, a major gas. Concrete is used to create hard surfaces which contribute to surface runoff that may cause soil erosion, water pollution and flooding. Conversely, concrete is one of the most powerful tools for proper flood control, by means of damming, diversion and deflection of flood waters, mud flows and the like. Concrete is a primary contributor to the urban heat island effect, but is less so than asphalt. Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution. The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity Wet concrete is highly alkaline and should always be handled with proper protective equipment. Concrete recycling is increasing in response to improved environmental awareness, legislation and economic considerations. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Badly planned; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Harmful; Pollution and flooding",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2006), www.en.wikipedia.org, Green Building Market City; Subramanian, S., Sustainability-Challenges and solutions (2007) The Indian Concrete Journal, pp. 39-50. , December; Sharipudin, S.A., Ridzuan, A.R.M., Saman, H.M., The Effect of FRCA and WPSA on the Strength Properties of Foamed Concrete (2010) Jurnal Intelek, 6 (1), pp. 105-110; Maheswari, M., Vidivelli, B., The use of sheet glass powder as fine aggregatre replacement in concrete (2010) The Open Civil Engineering Journal, 4, pp. 65-71; Dhir, R.K., Carthy, M.J., Use of conditioned PFA as fine aggregate component in concrete (2000) J.

Currently global research efforts are focused on primary and secondary recycling of PET waste or through landfills. Chemical recycling of PET through hydrolytic or aminolytic route has been attempted by many researchers however with limited end applications. In our investigations we have used PET waste as a synthon and chemically converted it through a new non-catalytic route into several benzamide derivatives. We have successfully tested them for antistripping performance in bitumen. Our results as elaborated in the paper indicate a comparable performance of the new chemistry products based on PET, to commercially used antistripping chemicals. Our research work thus opens a new route for the recycling of used PET in bituminous concrete roads which may help in alleviating a major environmental problem and disposal of waste PET polymer in large scale. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A major open issue is whether ACM wastes, produced after reclamation, should be destined to landfill burial or recycling. After a short history of asbestos as building material, classification, properties and health effects of asbestos minerals, this chapter will describe the methods for the reclamation and disposal of ACMs and attractive recycling solutions as a safe alternative to landfill disposal. Amongst them, recycling of thermally treated cement asbestos for the production of concrete and geopolymers will be illustrated in detail. © Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2013.

In this study, the Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) of 15% was replaced by fly ash to mitigate the potential of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) expansion, the crushed nitric acid-treated CRT funnel glass sand (TCF) was used to replace river sand fine aggregate of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% in the highdensity concrete. The fresh, mechanical properties of the high-density concrete containing TCF glass sand were studied, the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) of the mortar and drying shrinkage of the concrete were also evaluated. The test results showed that the use of TCF glass sand improved the fresh properties of the concrete, but reduced the mechanical properties of the concrete. Furthermore, at the drying period of 56 days, all concrete mixtures had an acceptable drying shrinkage value below 0.075%. ASR expansion values of the mortar with TCF glass sand were found to be below the limit of 0.1% at tested age of 14 days. Preliminary results obtained from this study had demonstrated that the CRT funnel glass (an original hazardous material) can be treated, processed and reutilized for the production of the high-density concrete. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An economical viable solution to this problem should include utilization of waste materials for new products which in turn minimize the heavy burden on the nation's landfills. Recycling of waste construction materials saves natural resources, saves energy, reduces solid waste, reduces air and water pollutants and reduces greenhouse gases. The construction industry can start being aware of and take advantage of the benefits of using waste and recycled materials. Studies have investigated the use of acceptable waste, recycled and reusable materials and methods. The use of swine manure, animal fat, silica fume, roofing shingles, empty palm fruit bunch, citrus peels, cement kiln dust, fly ash, foundry sand, slag, glass, plastic, carpet, tire scraps, asphalt pavement and concrete aggregate in construction is becoming increasingly popular due to the shortage and increasing cost of raw materials. In this study a questionnaire survey targeting experts from construction industry was conducted in order to investigate the current practices of the uses of waste and recycled materials in the construction industry. This study presents an initial understanding of the current strengths and weaknesses of the practice intended to support construction industry in developing effective policies regarding uses of waste and recycled materials as construction materials. © 2013 Science Publication.","Construction materials; Environmental concerns; Natural resources; Recycled materials","atmospheric pollution; construction industry; construction material; greenhouse gas; landfill; natural resource; pollution policy; recycling; solid waste; water pollution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lebdeh, T., Hamoush, S., Heard, W., Zornig, B., Effect of matrix strength on pullout behavior of steel fiber reinforced very-high strength concrete composites (2010) Constr.

In addition, current disposal practices are being phased out due to their adverse environmental impacts. In this project, CRT glass was used as a fine aggregate replacement in concrete. Life-cycle material characterization was conducted by evaluating the durability and strength of the CRT-Concrete. Leaching tests were also conducted to investigate whether the material meets drinking water limits for Pb. Test results show that the plastic state of the CRT-Concrete was affected by the angularity of the glass particles. Moreover, the compressive strength of CRT-Concrete met and exceeded that of the control specimen. However, CRT-Concrete was susceptible to expansive alkali-silica reactions when more than 10% CRT replacement was used. Environmental leaching results show that lead concentrations from CRT-Concrete are below the drinking water limits depending on the CRT volume replacement and if biopolymers are used. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CRT; Durability; Glass recycling; Heavy metals; Sustainable concrete; Waste management","Adverse environmental impacts; Environmental property; Expansive alkali-silica reactions; Glass aggregates; Glass recycling; Lead concentration; Material characterizations; Sustainable concretes; Aggregates; Biopolymers; Cathodes; Compressive strength; Durability; Expansive concrete; Glass; Heavy metals; Leaching; Lead; Silica; Tubes (components); Waste management; Cathode ray tubes; alkali; cement; concrete; drinking water; glass; lead; silicon dioxide; aggregate; compressive strength; concentration (composition); concrete; drinking water; durability; glass; heavy metal; leaching; lead; mechanical property; polymer; recycling; silica; toxicity; waste management; article; cathode ray tube; chemical analysis; chemical composition; compressive strength; concentration (parameters); controlled study; degradation kinetics; environmental factor; leaching; long term exposure; particle size; pH measurement; priority journal; recycling; Cathode Ray Tube; Compressive Strength; Construction Materials; Drinking Water; Glass; Hazardous Waste; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lead; Mechanical Phenomena; Recycling; Refuse Disposal",,"lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Drinking Water; Hazardous Waste; Lead, 2P299V784P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2007) ASTM International, , ASTM C1260-07, Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar Method); (2007) ASTM International, , ASTM C127, Standard Test Method for Density, Specific Gravity, and Absorption of Coarse Aggregate; (2007) ASTM International, , ASTM C128, Standard Test Method for Density, Specific Gravity, and Absorption of Fine Aggregate; (2010) ASTM International, , ASTM C39-10, Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens; (2011) ASTM International, , ASTM C617-11, Standard Practice for Capping Cylindrical Concrete Specimens; Chen, C.H., Huang, R., Wu, J.K., Yang, C.C., Waste E-glass particles used in cementitious mixtures (2006) Cem.

While alumina itself is relatively harmless, the grit blasting waste is regarded as hazardous when contaminated with heavy metals. The concrete industry has initiated the use of solid waste additives in order to address environmental problems. We studied the feasibility of using alumina waste (AW) as a partial replacement for the fine aggregate in self-compacting concrete (SCC). The mixtures were designed to produce a controlled slump flow diameter. The fine aggregate was replaced with up to 100% AW by weight. The rheological and mechanical properties of the SCC mixtures were evaluated based on slump flow, J-ring flow, blocking assessment, V-funnel, air content, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements. The filling and passing ability of the fresh concrete decreased in proportion to the alumina content. Mixtures containing up to 75% AW possessed average compressive strengths of 20.9 MPa at 3 days and 45.9 MPa at 28 days. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The environmental aspects were investigated performing leaching tests.The results suggested that SBA satisfied the environmental Italian law for reuse of non-hazardous waste but affected significantly the stress-strain behavior of the final products.

Electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) is characterized as a hazardous material, due to its heavy metals content and a powder form. A present study indicates the possibility of domestic carbon steel EAFD stabilization by using cement as the main stabilizer, fly ash as an additive, and controlling the EAFD particle size by milling. EAFD replaced 0-50% of fine aggregate and fly ash replaced 10-25% of cement in mixtures, with different milling times applied. S/S samples were tested for compressive strength and heavy metals leachability. The results of compressive strength testing showed that the maximum EAFD replacement is 15%, after which compressive strength decreases rapidly. The best fly ash compressive strength was attained at 10% replacement of both fine aggregate and cement. The milled EAFD produced the best results at three hours of milling, however, the addition of fly ash resulted in a slight compressive strength decrease in these samples. The TCLP analysis of concrete samples indicated that Zn and Pb were stabilized in the cement matrix even at 30% of fine aggregate replacement with EAFD. From the physical-mechanical and environmental aspects, EAFD can be used as a component in cement mixtures in instances when the Zn and Pb content is not sufficiently high for justifiable valorization of these metals.","Compressive strength; Concrete; Eafd; Fly ash; Solidification/stabilization; Tclp","Cement matrix; Cement mixtures; Compressive strength testing; Concrete samples; Direct smelting; Eafd; Electric arc furnace; Electric arc furnace dust; Environmental aspects; Fine aggregates; Heavy metals content; Leachability; Milling time; Scrap recycling; Solidification/stabilization; Tclp; Aggregates; Carbon steel; Cements; Concretes; Fly ash; Lead; Milling (machining); Scrap metal reprocessing; Zinc; Compressive strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Caldas de Souza, C.A., Machado, A.T., de Pinho, A.L.L.R., Câmara, C.R.J., (2010) Mater.

In order to follow and fulfill the defined aims and criteria, our society is increasingly oriented on the construction industry, which causes the decline of the natural resources, disturbs chain sustainability and has major impacts on the environment. On the other hand, it has predisposition to be one of the biggest ""consumers"" of the produced industrial waste containing recyclable components as secondary raw material. The secondary raw material is used in still higher replacement of the mineral wealth. Its appropriate characteristics and usability without prior treatment in large volumes offer not only material benefits but also great economic benefits to the constructors, the building companies. Several aspects are important to consider the complete benefits of the industrial waste management: economic benefits, savings of natural resources, environmental aspect (toxic metals, radioactivity) and regional ""the quality of life"" aspect as well. The coal combustion processes and exhaust cleanings in the energy industry are associated with the production of the large quantity of the solid waste. Solid residues from the coal combustion and flue gas desulphurization have major environmental impacts. The fly ash from gas retained in the separation plants has the largest share on generation of solid waste in the energy production, usually around 80% of the total produced waste amount. Fly ash can be used in different areas of the building engineering thanks to its appropriate characteristics. This chapter describes the possibilities and assesses impacts of Slovak brown coal fly ash utilization in the area of Slovak road engineering. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The study examines three leaching procedures for characterisation of the potential release of heavy metals and anions regulated by the EU Landfill Directive on seven recycled aggregates and two natural materials. The goal of the study is to relate the complex procedures designed for analysis of material leaching behaviour to quick leaching tests used for regulatory purposes. To integrate the data, results of the compliance test, availability test and percolation test were related to each other. The results revealed that two recycled aggregates (the asphaltic and a concrete material) could be classified as inert material and the remainder were categorised as non-hazardous. Finally, the statistical analysis conducted permitted the identification of the group of heavy metals which are close to their acceptance thresholds. Thus, the noticeable amounts of Ni, Cr, Sb, Zn and Cu warrant their consideration as relevant from an environmental point of view. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper advocates the sustainable development that meets the needs of present generations without compromising the rights of future generations to meet their needs. Natural resources are general and common good and their use should be planned and directed and purpose controlled. The rapid technological development in recent decades has necessitated serious human addressing the issues related to management of waste generated in various technological operations, and as a final waste in the use of final products. Recycling Technology of CWM (Construction Waste Material) resulting from construction, and more frequently from demolition of various types of buildings. CWM usually consists of: waste wood, various metals, concrete, bricks, blocks, tiles, glass, asphalt, etc. There are also several types of devices and procedures for the recycling of CWM. CWM recycling process includes: demolition of old or damaged structures, development of towns and villages, various destructions, earthquakes, floods, etc. Construction waste is the second largest waste type, immediately after the municipal solid waste. Construction waste is divided into rubble, soil, waste from the reconstruction of roads, and waste from the construction sites. The rubble itself can be dangerous because it may contain asbestos, which is very harmful to human health, or acids, paints, varnishes, thinners, means for removing rust, paint or varnish, wood coatings, oil filters, mineral oils and others.

In low-lying coastal floodplains, the remediation strategies of groundwater manipulation (e.g. fixed-level weirs) and tidal buffering (e.g. two-way modified floodgates) are not feasible due to the risk of flooding during heavy rainfall events and their inability to prevent pyritic oxidation. In view of this in 2006, the first pilot subsurface permeable reactive barrier (PRB) using recycled concrete for the remediation of acidic groundwater (- pH 3) was employed in ASS terrain in southeast New South Wales, Australia. While monitoring has confirmed the PRB has successfully neutralized the acidic groundwater to - pH 7.3 and removed - 95% of Al and Fe, this technology is not without its challenges. These have included the: (1) selection of the appropriate reactive material; (2) elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the neutralization of the acidic groundwater; (3) chemical armouring and possible clogging of the recycled concrete by Al and Fe oxy/hydroxide precipitates; and (4) thus, uncertainty regarding the longevity of the PRB. This paper will present details on the screening process of reactive materials, the installation of the PRB, the column experiments simulating the flow of acidic groundwater through the PRB for the determination of the predominant neutralization reactions occurring within the PRB, the long-term performance of the PRB and the current research strategy for determining its longevity. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Geo-environmental problems; Innovative engineering; Neutralization reaction; New South Wales , Australia; Permeable reactive barrier technologies; Permeable reactive barriers; Potentially toxic metals; Remediation strategies; Aluminum; Concretes; Floods; Geotechnical engineering; Groundwater; Pollution; Recycling; Toxic materials; Groundwater pollution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Banasiak, L.J., (2004) The Role of A Subsurface Lime-fly Ash Barrier in the Mitigation of Acid Sulphate Soils, , ME Thesis, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia; Bush, R.T., Sullivan, L.A., Morphology and behaviour of greigite from a Holocene sediment in eastern Australia (1997) Aust.

Solid wastes encompass the heterogeneous mass of throwaways from the urban community as well as the homogeneous accumulations of agricultural, industrial and mineral wastes. Biomedical waste pose a significant impact on health and environment. A proper waste management system should be required to dispose hazardous biomedical waste and incineration should be the best available technology to reduce the volume of this hazardous waste. The incineration process destroys pathogens and reduces the waste volume and weight but leaves a solid material called biomedical waste ash as residue which increases the levels of heavy metals, inorganic salts and organic compounds in the environment. Disposal of biomedical waste ash in landfill may cause contamination of groundwater as metals are not destroyed during incineration.The limited space and the high cost for land disposal led to the development of recycling technologies and the reuse of ash in different systems. In order to minimize leaching of its hazardous components into the environment several studies confirmed the successful utilization of biomedical waste ash in agriculture and construction sector. This paper presents the overview on the beneficial use of ash in agriculture and construction materials and its leachate characteristics. This review also stressed on the need to further evaluate the leachate studies of the ashes and slag for their proper disposal and utilization. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Biomedical waste ash; Concrete; Leachate","cement; ground water; heavy metal; inorganic salt; organic compound; cost-benefit analysis; environmental impact; environmental issue; globalization; groundwater pollution; hazardous waste; health impact; hospital sector; incineration; landfill; leachate; recycling; solid waste; urban area; waste management; waste technology; waste treatment; weight; agriculture; ash; biomedical waste ash; building material; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); hospital waste; incineration; landfill; leaching; physical chemistry; recycling; review; solid waste management; water contamination; Compressive Strength; Incineration; Medical Waste; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"Medical Waste; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Mutairi, N., Terro, M., Al-Khaleefi, A.L., Effect of recycling hospital ash on the compressive properties of concrete: statistical assessment and predicting model (2004) Build.

An alternative is to use by-products, provided their quality is improved. The paper presents surface modification of recycled aggregate concrete using biodeposition involving a method employing Sporosarcina pasteurii (Bacillus pasteurii) bacteria. It was possible to obtain reduction in water absorption of aggregate, the effect was more visible in case of finer fractions and for aggregates originating from inferior quality concrete. Calcium chloride was used for precipitation of calcium carbonate, while culture medium consisting of beef extract, peptone and urea was used for cultivation of microorganisms. In addition, whey, ecologically dangerous by-product from dairy industry was found to be effective as a culture medium. Presence of calcium carbonate crystals covering aggregate grains was confirmed by observations under scanning electron microscope. In the perspective, the proposed method, upon appropriate improvements, seems worthwhile due to ecological and technological reasons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We collected existing information through an Internet survey using the keywords ""Medical Waste Management,"" ""Health Hazards,"" and ""Bangladesh."" Medical wastes that are disposed in open places in the city are hazardous and toxics. Moreover, waste management and practices were found to be quite unsafe. Poor people collect the waste and sell it for recycling. Almost 85.0% of sharp injuries are caused between their usage and subsequent disposal. More than 20.0% of those who handle them encounter ""stick"" injuries. Another study showed that people use an average of 3.4 injections per year, in which 39.3% were administered with reused equipment for low level of management. There is no initiative for present MWM system by government or INGOs, and no concrete regulation has been established yet. Few researchers and INGOs have done little. Women and children are more vulnerable because they handle the waste with bare hands; exposing them to contamination with HIV or hepatitis B and other diseases. Therefore, it is essential to follow sound medical waste management system and take actions for this public health problem. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","Bangladesh; health hazards; management; medical waste; practices",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jang, Y.C., Lee, C., Yoon, O.S., Kim, H., Medical waste management in Korea (2006) J Environ Manage, 80, pp. 107-115; Levendis, Y., Atal, A., Carlson, J., Quintana, M., PAH and soot emissions from burning components of medical waste: examination/surgical gloves and cotton pads (2001) Chemosphere, 42, pp. 775-783; (2002) Basic Steps in the Preparation of Health Care Waste Management Plans for Health Care Establishments, , Amman, Jordan: Author; Karamouz, M., Zahraie, B., Kerachian, R., Jaafarzadeh, N., Mahjouri, N., Developing a master plan for hospital solid waste management: a case study (2007) Waste Management, 27, pp. 626-638; Silva, C.E., Hoppe, A.E., Ravanello, M.M., Mello, N., Medical wastes management in the south Brazil (2005) Waste Management, 25, pp. 600-605; Coronel, B., Durosellet, P., Behrt, H., Moskovtchenko, J.F., Freney, J., In situ decontamination of medical wastes using oxidative agents: a 16-month study in a polyvalent intensive care unit (2002) J Hosp Infect, 50, pp. 207-212; Chintis, V., Chintis, S., Vaidya, K., Ravikant, S., Patil, S., Chintis, D.S., Bacterial population changes in hospital effluent treatment plant in central India (2004) Water Research, 38, pp. 441-447; Sabour, R.M., Mohamedifard, A., Kamalan, H., A mathematical model to predict the composition and generation of hospital wastes in Iran (2007) Waste Management, 27, pp. 584-587; Birpinar, M.E., Bilgili, M.S., Erdogan, T., Medical waste management in Turkey: a case study of Istanbul (2008) Waste Management, 29, pp. 445-448; Muhlich, M., Scherrer, M., Daschner, F.D., Comparison of infectious waste management in European hospitals (2003) J Hosp Infect, 55, pp. 260-268; (1999) Medical Waste in Developing Countries.

These nano-particles are potentially dangerous if released into the environment. Preliminary studies are carried out on sludge-blended cement concrete (SBCC) formed into specimens of cylindrical concrete with 10 cm diameter and 20 cm height. They are with 10 wt.% cement replaced by CMP sludge powder. Three water/cementitious (W/C) ratios were selected to mold the specimens for setting time, XRD analysis, TCLP analysis and compressive strength and stress-strain tests, respectively. TCLP test results revealed that the concentrations of leached heavy metals were substantially below the regulatory thresholds. The strengths of the SBCC specimens were comparable to those of the ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) specimens with 3-day curing and about 22-38% much higher than those of OPCC cylindrical concrete specimens at 7-91 days of age. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recycling CMP sludge into construction materials, a positive step for sustainable development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Groundwater manipulation using weirs and modified floodgates is not effective in low-lying floodplains due to the high risk of flooding and their inability to prevent pyrite oxidation. Permeable reactive barrier (PRB) technology has been looked at as an alternative remediation technique in ASS terrain. Batch and short-term column tests were used to choose a suitable reactive material for the remediation of acidic water and the removal of Al and Fe, with recycled concrete deemed the most effective. Following these tests, a pilot-scale PRB was installed in ASS terrain on the Shoalhaven Floodplain, southeast New South Wales, Australia in October 2006. Despite a slow decrease in the performance of the PRB due to armouring effects caused by the precipitation of Al and Fe on the surface of the recycled concrete, continuous monitoring of the performance of the PRB over the last five years has shown an increase in pH to neutral (∼ pH 7.3) and ∼ 95% removal of Al and Fe from the groundwater. A long-term (30 months) column test conducted under controlled laboratory conditions for simulating the flow of acidic groundwater through the PRB determined that the predominant neutralisation reactions occurring within the PRB were the dissolution of carbonate/bicarbonate alkalinity, the redissolution of Al hydroxide precipitates and the re-dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxide minerals.","Environmental geotechnics","Acidic water; Australia; Column test; Continuous monitoring; Controlled laboratories; Environmental issues; Fe oxyhydroxide minerals; Flood plains; Geotechnics; Neutralisation; New South Wales; New South Wales , Australia; Permeable reactive barrier technologies; Pilot scale; Pyrite oxidation; Re-dissolution; Reactive materials; Recycled concretes; Sulphates; Toxic metals; Alkalinity; Aluminum; Banks (bodies of water); Dissolution; pH effects; Recycling; Remediation; Groundwater; alkalinity; environmental issue; floodplain; groundwater pollution; heavy metal; neutralization; oxidation; permeability; pH; pollution effect; pyrite; reactive barrier; soil pollution; soil remediation; terrain; toxic substance; Australia; New South Wales",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1998) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , APHA, 20th ed.

Electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) is characterized as a hazardous material, due to its heavy metals content and a powder form. A present study indicates the possibility of domestic carbon steel EAFD stabilization by using cement as the main stabilizer (S/S process), fly ash as an additive, and controlling the EAFD particle size by milling. EAFD replaced 0-50 % of Fine aggregate and fly ash replaced 10-25% of cement in mixtures, with different milling times applied. S/S samples were tested for compressive strength and heavy metals teachability. The results of compressive strength testing showed that the maximum EAFD replacement is 15%, after which compressive strength decreases rapidly. The best fly ash compressive strength was attained at 10% replacement of both fine aggregate and cement. The milled EAFD produced the best results at three hours of milling; however, the addition of fly ash resulted in a slight compressive strength decrease in these samples. The TCLP analysis of concrete samples indicated that In and Pb were stabilized in the cement matrix even (toxicity characteristic leachiing procedure) at 30% of Fine aggregate replacement with EAFD. From the physico-mechanical and environmental aspects, EAFD can be used as a component in cement mixtures in instances when the In and Pb content is not sufficiently high for justifiable valorization of these metals.","Compressive strength; Concrete; EAFD; Fly ash; Solidification/stabilization; TCLP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Caldas De Souza, C.A., Machado, A.T., Pinho De, A.L.L.R., Camara, C.R.J., (2010) Mater.

In addition, it is widely accepted that the particular waste stream contains hazardous materials, such as insulating materials, plastic frames of doors, windows, etc. Their uncontrolled disposal result to long-term pollution costs, resource overuse and wasted energy. Within the framework of the DEWAM project, a web-based Decision Support System (DSS) application - namely DeconRCM - has been developed, aiming towards the identification of the optimal construction and demolition waste (CDW) management strategy that minimises end-of-life costs and maximises the recovery of salvaged building materials. This paper addresses both technical and functional structure of the developed web-based application. The web-based DSS provides an accurate estimation of the generated CDW quantities of twenty-one different waste streams (e.g. concrete, bricks, glass, etc.) for four different types of buildings (residential, office, commercial and industrial). With the use of mathematical programming, the DeconRCM provides also the user with the optimal end-of-life management alternative, taking into consideration both economic and environmental criteria. The DSS's capabilities are illustrated through a real world case study of a typical five floor apartment building in Thessaloniki, Greece. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Construction and demolition waste; Decision Support System; DeconRCM; Web-based application","Accurate estimation; Apartment buildings; Construction activities; Construction and demolition waste; Decision supports; DeconRCM; End-of-life; End-of-life managements; Functional structure; Management strategies; Optimal construction; Optimal management; Pollution cost; Thessaloniki , Greece; Urban areas; Waste stream; Web-based applications; Web-based decision support systems; Apartment houses; Artificial intelligence; Building materials; Charge density waves; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Decision making; Decision support systems; Demolition; Energy conversion; Mathematical programming; Project management; User interfaces; Web services; Waste disposal; construction industry; decision support system; solid waste; urban area; waste disposal; waste management; World Wide Web; accuracy; article; building material; construction and demolition waste; construction work; cost control; decision support system; Greece; Internet; online system; priority journal; recycling; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Construction Materials; Decision Support Techniques; Greece; Internet; Refuse Disposal; Software; Waste Management; Waste Products; Central Macedonia; Greece; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]; Thessaloniki",,"Waste Products",,,,"The authors would like to thank Prof. E.

Three different leaching tests were used to assess the environmental impact of the produced material. Experimental results show that the replacement of MSWI fly ash could be taken up to 30% in the raw mixes. The good quality SAC clinkers are obtained by controlling the compositional parameters at alkalinity modulus (C m) around 1.05, alumina-sulfur ratio (P) around 2.5, alumina-silica ratio (N) around 2.0∼3.0 and firing the raw mixes at 1250 °C for 2. h. The compressive strengths of SAC are high in early age while that develop slowly in later age. Results also show that the expansive properties of SAC are strongly depended on the gypsum content. Leaching studies of toxic elements in the hydrated SAC-based system reveal that all the investigated elements are well bounded in the clinker minerals or immobilized by the hydration products. Although some limited positive results indicate that the SAC prepared from MSWI fly ash would present no immediate thread to the environment, the long-term toxicity leaching behavior needs to be further studied. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Clinker; Free expansion; Leaching test; MSWI fly ash; Sulfoaluminate","Clinker; Free expansions; Leaching test; MSWI fly ash; Sulfoaluminate; Cements; Compressive strength; Environmental impact; Fly ash; Gypsum; Hydration; Incineration; Leaching; Materials testing; Municipal solid waste; Refuse incinerators; Silica; Sulfur; X ray diffraction; X ray diffraction analysis; Waste incineration; cement; sulfoaluminate cement; unclassified drug; compressive strength; concrete; environmental impact assessment; fly ash; incineration; leaching; municipal solid waste; recycling; sulfur compound; toxicity; alkalinity; article; building material; cement clinker; cement industry; compressive strength; environmental impact; fly ash; hydration; industrial production; leaching; municipal solid waste incineration fly ash; priority journal; recycling; toxicity; X ray diffraction; Aluminum Compounds; Calcium Compounds; Coal Ash; Construction Materials; Hazardous Substances; Hot Temperature; Sulfur Compounds; Volatilization; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"Aluminum Compounds; Calcium Compounds; Coal Ash; Hazardous Substances; Sulfur Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; calcium sulfoaluminate",,,"2006AA06Z363; Tongji University: 2009KJ005; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China, SRFDP: 20090072110010","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program) (2006AA06Z363) of China, the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (20090072110010) of China, and the Program for Young Excellent Talents in Tongji University (2009KJ005), Shanghai, China.",,,,,,,,,,"Albino, V., Cioffi, R., Marroccoli, M., Santoro, L., Potential application of ettringite generating systems for hazardous waste stabilization (1996) J.

The ashes were submitted to the following assays: (a) evaluation of the leaching behaviour; (b) stabilization/solidification of fly ashes and evaluation of the leaching behaviour of the stabilized/solidified (s/s) materials; (c) production of concrete from bottom and circulating ashes. The eluates of all materials were submitted to chemical and ecotoxicological characterizations. The crude ashes have shown similar chemical and ecotoxicological properties. The s/s materials have presented compressive strengths between 25 and 40. MPa, low emission levels of metals through leaching and were classified as non-hazardous materials. The formulations of concrete have presented compressive strengths between 12 and 24. MPa. According to the Dutch Building Materials Decree, some concrete formulations can be used in both scenarios of limited moistening and without insulation, and with permanent moistening and with insulation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Ashes; Co-combustion; Coal; Concrete; Meat and bone meal; Sewage sludge","Circulating ashes; Cocombustion; Combustion of coal; Combustion test; Concrete productions; Ecotoxicological; Low emission; Meat and bone meal; Stabilization/solidification; Bone; Building materials; Characterization; Coal; Coal ash; Compressive strength; Construction equipment; Electric power plant loads; Electric power plants; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed combustors; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Leaching; Sewage sludge; Waste incineration; Coal combustion; coal; concrete; chemical property; coal; combustion; compressive strength; concrete; ecotoxicology; fly ash; industrial waste; leaching; recycling; sludge; solidification; article; ash; bottom ash; circulating ash; co combustion; combustion; compressive strength; controlled study; ecotoxicology; electric power plant; fluidized bed; fly ash; industrial production; leaching; physical parameters; priority journal; recycling; sludge; solidification; stabilization; Coal Ash; Compressive Strength; Construction Materials; Materials Testing; Metals, Heavy; Power Plants; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"Coal Ash; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"European Commission, EC: FP6-SUSTDEV","This study was developed under the European project COPOWER (SES6-CT-2004-503806), which was funded by the European Commission under the FP6-SUSTDEV .",,,,,,,,,,"Aguiar del Toro, M., Calmano, W., Ecke, H., Wet extraction of heavy metals and chloride from MSWI and straw combustion fly ashes (2009) Waste Manag., 29, pp. 2494-2499; Ahmaruzzaman, M., A review on the utilization of fly ash (2010) Prog.

Though timber processing waste is a sustainable and renewable source of fuel for energy production, the thermal process of converting the aforementioned biomass into heat energy produces significant amounts of fine wood waste ash as a by-product material which, if not managed properly, may result in serious environmental and health problems. Several current researches had been carried out to incorporate wood waste ash as a cement replacement material in the production of greener concrete material and also as a sustainable means of disposal for wood waste ash. Results of the researches have indicated that wood waste ash can be effectively used as a cement replacement material for the production of structural grade concrete of acceptable strength and durability performances. This paper presents an overview of the work carried out by the use of wood waste ash as a partial replacement of cement in mortar and concrete mixes. Several aspects such as the physical and chemical properties of wood waste ash, properties of wood waste ash/OPC blended cement pastes, rheological, mechanical and the durability properties of wood waste ash/OPC concrete mix are detailed in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Blended cement; Cement replacement material; Green concrete material; Hazardous waste management; Reuse and recycling; Wood waste ash","Blended cement; Cement replacement material; Green concrete material; Hazardous waste management; Reuse and recycling; Cement industry; Cements; Chemical properties; Concrete mixers; Durability; Manufacture; Materials; Mortar; Sustainable development; Timber; Waste disposal; Wood products; Energy conversion; cement; concrete; biomass; cement; concrete; durability; mechanical property; mortar; recycling; replacement; rheology; waste management; wood ash; bulk density; calorimetry; cement industry; compressive strength; electric resistance; fertilizer application; freeze thawing; leaching; pollution control; product development; recycling; review; soil property; temperature sensitivity; tensile strength; water absorption; wood ash; wood debris; Ash; Biomass; Cement; Chemical Properties; Durability; Forests; Materials; Mortar; Waste Disposal; Wood Products; Wood Waste",,,,,"1001/PPBGN/843086; Universiti Sains Malaysia: 1001/441/29301/CIPS/AUPE001","The review work is jointly supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Fellowship Programme [RU: 1001/441/29301/CIPS/AUPE001] and Research University Postgraduate Research Grant Scheme (USM-RUPRGS) [Grant No. 1001/PPBGN/843086 ].",,,,,,,,,,"Abdullahi, M., Characteristics of wood ash/OPC concrete (2006) Leonardo Electronic J Pract Technol, 8, pp. 9-16; Specifications for coal fly ash and raw or calcined natural pozzolan for use as mineral admixture in concrete (1998) Annual Book of ASTM Standards; Bramryd, T., Frashman, B., Silvicultural use of wood ashes - Effects on the nutrient and heavy metal balance in a pine (Pinus sylvestris, L.) forest soil (1995) Water, Air and Soil Pollution Proceeding of the 1995 5th International Conference on Acidic Deposition: Science and Policy, Acid Reign'95, Part II, Vol. 85 (2), pp. 1039-1044. , Kluwer Academic Publishers Dordrecht, Netherland; Campbell, A.G., Recycling and disposing of wood ash (1990) TAPPI J, 73 (9), pp. 141-143; Efnarc, (2002) Specification and Guidelines for Self-compacting Concrete, , EFNARC Publication London; Elinwa, A.U., Ejeh, S.P., Effects of incorporation of sawdust incineration fly ash in cement pastes and mortars (2004) J Asian Architecture Build Eng, 3 (1), pp. 1-7; Elinwa, A.U., Ejeh, S.P., Akpabio, I.O., (2005) Using Metakaolin to Improve Sawdust Ash Concrete, , Concrete International; Elinwa, A.U., Ejeh, S.P., Mamuda, A.M., Assessing of the fresh concrete properties of self-compacting concrete containing sawdust ash (2008) Construction and Building Materials, 22 (6), pp. 1178-1182. , DOI 10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.02.004, PII S0950061807000414; Elinwa, A.U., Mahmood, Y.A., Ash from timber waste as cement replacement material (2002) Cement and Concrete Composites, 24 (2), pp. 219-222. , DOI 10.1016/S0958-9465(01)00039-7, PII S0958946501000397; Etiegni, L., Campbell, A.G., Physical and chemical characteristics of wood ash (1991) Bioresource Technol, 37 (2), pp. 173-178; Fehrs, J.E., Ash from the combustion of treated wood: Characterization and management options (1996) Presented at the National Bioash Utilization Conference, p. 20. , Portland, ME; Fytianos, K., Tsaniklidi, B., Voudrias, E., Leachability of heavy metals in Greek fly ash from coal combustion (1998) Environment International, 24 (4), pp. 477-486. , DOI 10.1016/S0160-4120(98)00027-0, PII S0160412098000270; Horsakulthai, V., Phiuvanna, S., Kaenbud, W., Investigation on the corrosion resistance of bagasse-rice husk-wood ash blended cement concrete by impressed voltage (2011) Constr Build Mater, 25 (1), pp. 54-60; Karuppiah, M., Gupta, G., Toxicity of and metals in coal combustion ash leachate (1997) Journal of Hazardous Materials, 56 (1-2), pp. 53-58. , DOI 10.1016/S0304-3894(97)00034-4, PII S0304389497000344; Naik, T.R., (1999) Tests of Wood Ash As A Potential Source for Construction Materials.

Use of hazardous waste in concrete-making will lead to green environment and sustainable concrete technology and so such concrete can also be called as 'Green' concrete. Concrete made with ceramic electrical insulator waste as coarse aggregate shows good workability, compressive, tensile and flexural strengths and modulus of elasticity. Further, study of its durability will ensure greater reliability in its usage. Permeation characters are used widely to quantify durability properties of concrete. This paper presents an experimental investigation on the permeation characteristics [volume of voids and water absorption (ASTM C642-06), chloride penetration (ASTM C1202-10), and sorption] of concrete with ceramic electrical insulator waste coarse aggregate (hereafter it is called recycled aggregate concrete) of six different water-cement ratios in comparison with those of corresponding conventional concrete mixes. From the results it has been observed that there is no significant change in the basic trend of permeation characteristics of this recycled aggregate concrete when compared to the conventional concrete. This recycled aggregate concrete possesses higher permeation characteristic values than those of conventional concrete. These values decrease with decrease in water-cement ratio for both the recycled aggregate concrete and the conventional concrete. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume properties and pavement performances of AC-25 asphalt mixture with asbestos tailings were also evaluated compared with those with basalt as aggregates. XRD and XRF measurement results infer that asbestos tailing is an excellent road material. Volume properties of AC-25 asphalt mixture with asbestos tailings satisfied the related specifications. No heavy metals and toxic pollution were detected in AAS test and the value of pH test is 8.23, which is help to the adhesion with asphalt in the asphalt concrete. When compared with basalt, high temperature property and the resistance to low temperature cracking of AC-25 asphalt mixture was improved by using asbestos tailings as aggregates.

The study focussed on the composition of the structural materials as well as on individual construction materials, structural elements and recycled construction materials. The use of mineral construction materials, which account for some 90 % of the total material, has undergone some changes in the past decades. The use of stone decreased from more than 40 % at the beginning of the 20th century to 0 % in the 1960s. The use of bricks dropped to less then 40 % during the second half of the 20th century, whereas the use of concrete increased to more than 70 % during the same period. The harmful substances studied included the total concentrations of selected heavy metals and organic substances (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls). The eluates of the mineral construction materials were, in addition, tested for SO42-, NO3-, NO2-, Cl- and NH4+as well as the matrix elements Ca, Si and Al. Certain building materials, such as tiles, fills, slag concrete and structures containing tar, showed some enrichment in heavy materials. Concrete was the only one of the materials studied to show a low heavy-metal concentration throughout. In some fractions of the recycled construction materials studied, the parameters NO3-, NO2- and partly also SO42+ in the eluate cause problems when recycled or even deposited in building-waste landfills. Selective renaturing (returning to natural condition) is what is needed for eliminating these and other harmful substances from the construction-materials cycle and obtain high-quality secondary products. In addition, such an approach can help to reduce emissions generated during demolition and through the use of contaminated recycled construction materials. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"aluminum; calcium; construction material; multistorey building; PAH; PCB; recycling; residential development; toxic substance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brunner, P.H., Stämpfli, D.M., Material Balance of a Construction Waste Sorting Plant (1993) Waste Management & Research, 11, pp. 27-48; (2008) Verordnung über die Ablagerung von Abfällen, , Bundesministerium für Land-und Forstwirtschaft Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft BGBl.II Nr. 39/2008 Bundesministerium für Land- und Forstwirtschaft Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft; (2006) Bundes-Abfallwirtschaftsplan 2006, , Bundesministerium für Land-und Forstwirtschaft, u. u.

Samples of waste water from several points of a water recycling process from a ready-mixed concrete plant were examined for their chemical properties (Cl-, SO42-, alkalies, total solids, pH) and compared with the specifications applied for concrete mixing water. Also samples of dry sludge powder from the water-recycling process tank were taken and tested for their chemical composition, particle size distribution, mineralogical composition and thermogravimetrical results. The water samples were examined for their behavior in concrete specimens with and without admixtures and also for their effect in water demand and setting times in cement pastes. All tests showed that waste water is suitable for concrete mixing water and that it can be used without any treatment or dilution, thus contributing to water saving. Waste water from ready-mixed concrete plants is classified as waste hazardous for disposal due to its high pH value (over 11.5). Very few ready-mixed concrete plants that recycle waste water follow a complicated process through multiple overflows and a stage of neutralization, with HClaq addition. It is obvious that the results of this investigation contribute to the protection of the environment from hazardous waste water disposal and the ready-mixed concrete industry from fresh water costs and any additional cost for buying and conserving an unnecessarily complicated water-recycling system. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Concretes; pH; Strength of materials; Waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Standard specification for mixing water used in the production of hydraulic cement concrete (2006) American Society for Testing and Materials, , ASTM C 1602/C 1602M; Borger, J., Carrasquillo, R.L., Fowler, D.W., Use of recycled wash water and returned plastic concrete in the production of fresh concrete (1994) Advanced Cement Based Materials, 1, pp. 267-274; Chatveera, B., Lertwattanaruk, P., Use of ready-mixed concrete plant sludge water in concrete containing an additive or admixture (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 90, pp. 1901-1908; Chatveera, B., Lertwattanaruk, P., Makul, N., Effect of sludge water from ready-mixed concrete plant on properties and durability of concrete (2006) Cement and Concrete Composites, 28, pp. 441-450; Water for mixing and curing of concrete (1979) Hellenic Standard ELOT 345, , ELOT, Athens; Mixing water for concrete - specification for sampling, testing and assessing the suitability of water, including water recovered from processes in the concrete industry, as mixing water for concrete (2002) EN 1008, , European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Brussels; Methods of testing cement - Part 3: Determination of setting times and soundness (2008), EN 196-3, European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Brussels; Testing hardened concrete - Part 2: Making and curing specimens for strength tests (2008), EN 12390-2, European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Brussels; (2009), EN 12350-4, European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Brussels; Paolini, M., Khurana, R., Admixtures for recycling of waste concrete (1998) Cement and Concrete Composites, 20, pp. 221-229; Sandrolini, F., Franzoni, E., Waste wash water recycling in ready-mixed concrete plants (2001) Cement and Concrete Research, 31, pp. 485-489; Sealey, B.J., Phillips, P.S., Hill, G.J., Waste management issues for the UK ready-mixed concrete industry (2001) Resources Conservation and Recycling, 32, pp. 321-331; Su, N., Miao, B., Liu, F., Effect of wash water and underground water on properties of concrete (2002) Cement and Concrete Research, 32, pp. 777-782","Tsimas, S.; Laboratory of Analytical and Inorganic Chemistry, , Athens, Greece",,,,,,,,14777835,,,,"English","Manage.

Seventy-two laboratory prepared concrete composites were tested to investigate the effect of using various PVAW/C ratios of 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, and 0.45 on the slump, compressive strength, flexural strength, and dry density of the concrete mixes. Results indicated a slight to moderate increase in compressive strength and hard density values compared to those of the control concrete made with fresh water at 7 and 28 day curing. On the contrary, a reduction in the slump values of the PVAW-concrete was observed compared to the slump of the control mixes. However, the slump values increased with increasing the PVAW/C ratios. On the other hand, the waste material leaching test revealed that none of the PVAW toxic constituents was detected. The findings of this work would form basic information for recycling PVAW in concrete mixes and indicate a potential alternative for diminution the adverse effects on the environment posed by the hazardous effluent of the polyvinyl acetate resin industry. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Today, the innovative engineering solutions to problems involve using technologies that are both cost effective and environmentally friendly. These kinds of technologies use energy, water, land, and other natural resources in a way that is in the long-term best interest of the world inhabitants and the overall ecosystem. Airports are no exception to the above trend. With time, especially with new construction of terminal buildings and airside and landside spaces, emphasis is being given to the overall sustainable design and practices starting very early in the life of a project. Beginning from the planning phase and extending into design and then towards the construction and post construction activities. The purpose of this paper is to present the Airport Development Programme at the Toronto Pearson International Airport (TPIA) as an example of sustainable design. TPIA is the first North American airport to achieve ISO 14001 certification. The paper outlines the sustainable goals set very early in the life from the building demolition and apron design projects, the issues encountered during the design and construction phases and the results obtained at the end of these projects. The lessons learnt are discussed with a summary of future sustainable goals as part of continuous improvement towards achieving higher sustainability measures. One of the major components of the Airport Development Programme (ADP) was the Decommissioning and Demolition of the Old Terminal One and Terminal Two. The planning and design process addressed hazardous material decommissioning, demolition methodology, material salvage, recycling and processing. The new apron and associated infrastructure design and construction projects involved the use of crushed aggregates resulting from material handling and processing of existing concrete pavements and demolished buildings, use of local and recycled materials, use of best practices in storm water management for prevention and removal of glycol, hydrocarbons and total suspended solids and reducing on-site material transfer to landfill sites. The sustainable measures implemented on ADP provide a benchmark for future projects at TPIA and throughout North America in providing an example of cost effective and innovative solutions utilizing best sustainable practices.",,"Airport development; Best-practices; Building demolition; Continuous improvements; Cost effective; Crushed aggregates; Demolished buildings; Design and construction; Design projects; Environmentally-friendly; Infrastructure design; Innovative engineering; Innovative solutions; International airport; ISO 14001 certification; Landfill site; Material handling; New constructions; North American; On-site materials; Planning and design; Planning phase; Post construction; Recycled materials; Stormwater managements; Sustainable design; Sustainable practices; Terminal buildings; Toronto; Total suspended solids; Civil engineering; Concrete aggregates; Concrete construction; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Demolition; Design; Ecology; Glycols; Hydrocarbons; Innovation; Materials; Materials handling; Project management; Recycling; Sustainable development; Water management; Airports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) GTAA Greenhouse Gases Policy, , Greater Toronto Airports Authority, December; (2008) GTAA Environmental Policy, , Greater Toronto Airports Authority, January; (2009) GTAA Environment Programme 2009 - Targets, , March 5; Nowak, G., Sustainability - How it pertains to Airport Pavement Construction (2009) 2009 Swift Conference, , Toronto, Canada, September 14; (2000) Specification Documents TP-G01-001 Apron Stage 2; (2004) Specification Documents TP-G02-001 Apron Stage 2; (2003) Terminal 1 Decommissioning and Demolition and T2 Modifications, , Specifications Documents, TP-C01-001; (2006) Terminal 2 Demolition, Apron and Bridge 193, , Specifications Documents, TP-C04-002; Nowak, G., Sustainability - How it pertains to airport pavement construction (2009) 2009 Swift Conference, , Toronto, Canada.

This fine-grained material contains high amounts of zinc and iron as well as significant amounts of potentially toxic elements such as lead, cadmium and chromium. Therefore, the treatment and stabilization of this industrial residue is necessary. Concrete is a well-known suitable environment for stabilization/solidification of materials which have leachable elements in need of fixation. The effect of the EAFD content on the mechanical and chemical performance of Portland cement concrete is investigated in this paper. The effect of the EAFD content on the setting time of cement slurry was also analyzed. The axial compressive strength of the concrete samples increases with the EAFD addition in the range of 10 to 20 wt. (%) EAFD; also the tensile strength increases with the EAFD addition. An increase in EAFD content significantly increases the setting time of the concrete. The acetic acid leaching and water solubilization tests indicate low mobility of the potentially toxic elements from the EAFD concrete composite. The results of the immersion tests show that the addition of EAFD to the concrete seems to reduce chloride penetration, which may help prevent pitting corrosion in reinforced concrete.","Cement matrix; Chloride; Diffusion; Electric-arc furnace dust; Leaching","Acid leaching; Axial compressive strength; Cement matrix; Cement slurry; Chemical performance; Chloride; Chloride penetration; Concrete composites; Concrete samples; Electric arc furnace; Electric-arc furnace dust; Fine-grained material; Immersion tests; Industrial residues; Low mobility; Pitting corrosion; Portland cement concretes; Potentially toxic elements; Setting time; Stabilization/solidification; Steel production; Water solubilization; Acetic acid; Cadmium; Chlorine compounds; Chromium; Compressive strength; Dust; Electric furnaces; Furnaces; Iron; Leaching; Metal refineries; Metallurgical furnaces; Pitting; Portland cement; Reinforced concrete; Stabilization; Steelmaking; Steelmaking furnaces; Tensile strength; Toxic materials; Setting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hagni, A.M., Hagni, R.D., Demars, C., Mineralogical characteristics of electric arc furnace dust (1991) Journal of the Minerals (JOM), 43, pp. 28-30; Sofilié, T., Rastovcan-Mioc, A., Cerjan-Stefanovié, S., Novosel-Radovié, V., Jenko, M., Characterization of steel mill electric-arc furnace dust (2004) Journal of Hazardous Materials, B109, pp. 59-79; Da Silva Machado, J.G.M., Brehm, F.A., Moraes, C.A.M., Dos Santos, C.A., Vilela, A.C.F., Characterization study of electric arc furnace dust phases (2006) Materials Research, 9 (1), pp. 41-45; Al-Zaid, R.Z., Al-Sugair, F.H., Al-Negheimish, A.I., Investigation of potential uses of electric-arc furnace dust (EAFD) in concrete (1997) Cement and Concrete Research, 27 (2), pp. 267-278. , PII S0008884696002049; Mikhail, S.A., Turcotte, A.M., Aota, J., Thermoanalytical study of EAF dust and its vitrification product (1996) Thermochimica Acta, 287 (1), pp. 71-79. , DOI 10.1016/0040-6031(96)02990-5, PII S0040603196029905; Pelino, M., Karamanov, A., Pisciella, P., Crisucci, S., Zonetti, D., Vitrification of electric arc furnace dusts (2002) Waste Management, 22, pp. 945-949; De Vargas, A.S., Masuero, A.B., Vilela, A.C.F., Investigations on the use of electric-arc furnace dust (EAFD) in Pozzolan-modified Portland cement I (MP) pastes (2006) Cement and Concrete Research, 36 (10), pp. 1833-1841. , DOI 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.06.003, PII S0008884606001670; Laforest, G., Duchesne, J., Investigation of stabilization/solidification for treatment of electric arc furnace dust: Dynamic leaching of monolithic specimens (2007) Cement and Concrete Research, 37 (12), pp. 1639-1646. , DOI 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.08.025, PII S0008884607001949; Hamilton, I.W., Sammes, N.M., Encapsulation of steel foundry bag house dusts in cement mortar (1999) Cement and Concrete Research, 29, pp. 55-61; Crank, J., (1964) The Mathematics of Diffusion, , Oxford University Press; Tumidajski, P.J., Chan, G.W., Feldman, R.F., Strathdee, G., A boltzmann-matano analysis of chloride diffusion (1995) Cement and Concrete Resarch, 25, pp. 1556-1566; (1993) Standard Test Method for Splitting Tensile Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens (C496-90), pp. 269-272. , ASTM Philadelphia, PA: ASTM Sect. 4, vol. 04.02 Annual book of ASTM Standards; Mendham, J., Denney, R.C., Barnes, J.D., Thomas, M.J.K., (2000) Vogel's Quantitative Chemical Analysis, , 6th ed.

Then, the construction technician is responsible, among others, through the design, material selection, construction, usage and final demolition, to reduce the environmental impact. There is a big interest to identify and quantify the factors that define such impact. The only way to improve the system is through an easy measurement and comparison of the resources consumed by different construction methods. The task is not simple because the system involves heterogeneous processing and agents, from the material extraction or fabrication throughout the demolition or recycling. Finally, a practical example is presented in which the consumed resources are identified and quantified during the foundation construction. The results from the study are worrisome due to the fact that 100% of the resources are sustainability barriers, for the reason that they are non renewable (90%) or toxic during production or edification (10%).","Environmental impact; Resources identification and quantification; Sustainable construction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baño Nieva, A., y Vigil-Escalera del Pozo, A., Guía de construcción sostenible (2005), p. 9. , Instituto Sindical de Trabajo, Ambiente y Salud (ISTAS).

A technology for recycling latex paint in Portland cement concrete with added value was developed at The University of Western Ontario. The present study investigates the leaching of hazardous species from concrete incorporating recycled paint, known as 'paintcrete' as a partial replacement for mixing water. Specimens from concrete mixtures with various proportions of paint were subjected to simulated field environments including freezing-thawing and wetting-drying cycles, both in fresh and simulated seawater. The leachates from these specimens were analysed for heavy metals and glycols. It was found that the leaching of heavy metals from concrete specimens incorporating 15-25% paint and subjected to wetting-drying and freezing-thawing cycles, either in fresh water or artificial seawater, was not significant compared with values measured for a reference concrete mixture with no paint. The leaching concentrations of heavy metals were well below the contaminant levels according to the hazardous waste regulatory limits. In addition, glycol concentrations in the leachates at the end of a total of 100 cycles of freezing-thawing were much lower than the concentration of glycols in the original paint. Glycol leachates were also found to be acceptable based on environmental guidelines for glycols in surface water.","Concrete structures; Environment; Recycling & reuse of materials","Added values; Artificial seawater; Concentration of; Concrete mixture; Concrete specimens; Concrete structures; Environment; Environmental guidelines; Freezing thawing cycles; Freezing-thawing; Fresh Water; Glycol concentration; Hazardous wastes; Latex paint; Leachability; Leachates; Leaching concentrations; Marine environment; Partial replacement; Portland cement concretes; Recycled paints; Regulatory limit; University of Western Ontario; Wetting-drying; Concrete mixers; Freezing; Glycols; Hazardous materials; Heavy metals; Heavy water; Latexes; Leaching; Paint; Portland cement; Recycling; Seawater; Thawing; Wetting; Concrete mixing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2003) Standard Test Method for Resistance of Concrete to Rapid Freezing and Thawing, 4 (2). , ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials), ASTM, West Conshohocken, PA, ASTM C666; (2006) Standard Practice for Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Laboratory, 4 (2). , ASTM (, ASTM, West Conshohocken, PA, ASTM C192; (2009) Standard Specification for Portland Cement, , ASTM, ASTM, West Conshohocken, PA, ASTM C150-09; (1994) Canadian Environmental Protection Act 1994: Section 53.

Owing to its high amorphous silica content, RHA has shown to be a valid supplementary cementing material in the production of concrete. This paper presents the physical and chemical properties of a new generation RHA that is off-white in color, is carbon neutral, and has no crystalline SiO2 and toxic metals. The effects on mechanical properties of a mixture using off-white rice hull ash (OWRHA) as partial replacement of white cement were also investigated. The OWRHA-blended concrete has higher compressive and splitting tensile strengths at various ages compared with the control mixture. It is shown that up to 15% of OWRHA could be advantageously blended with white cement to enhance white concrete performance without modifying the aesthetics of the final product. © 2010 ASCE.","Ashes; By-product; Cement; Mechanical properties; Recycling","Amorphous silica; Carbon neutrals; Concrete performance; Control mixtures; Environmental hazards; Partial replacement; Physical and chemical properties; Rice husk ash; Splitting tensile strength; Supplementary cementing materials; Toxic metals; White cement; White rice; White rice husk ashes; Cements; Chemical properties; Recycling; Silica; Tensile strength; Mechanical properties; ash; cement; chemical property; compressive strength; concrete; mechanical property; physical property; recycling; rice; silica; tensile strength",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beagle, E., (1978) Rice husk conversion to energy: Agricultural service bulletin 31, , Food and Agricultural Organization, Rome; Boateng, A.A., Fan, L.T., Walawender, W.P., Chee, C.S., Morphological and development of rice hulls derived charcoal in a fluidized bed reactor (1991) Fuel, 70, pp. 995-1000. , FUELAC, 0016-2361, 10.1016/0016-2361(91)90057-H; FAO statistical databases (2009), http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/default.aspx, FAO, (April 3, ); Ganesan, K., Rajagopal, K., Thangavel, K., Rice husk ash blended cement: Assessment of optimal level of replacement for strength and permeability properties of concrete (2008) Constr.

Due to lack of land filling space and its ever increasing cost, utilization of waste material and by-products has become an attractive alternative to disposal. Waste foundry sand (WFS) is one of such industrial by-product which could be used in various applications including construction materials such as Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM) and concrete. The beneficial use of such by-products in construction materials results in reducing the cost of construction materials' ingredients and also helps in reducing disposal problem. The leachate obtained from such materials may contain hazardous compounds, which may possibly effect the environment. So, it is important to know the characteristics of leachate obtained from waste foundry sand. Understanding the leachate characteristics ofWFSis essential in its disposal, environmental impact, and potential development for beneficial utilization towards solid waste management. This paper describes the physical, chemical properties of WFS, various leachate test methods, and research published on leachate characteristics of waste foundry sand. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce cost, the crushed materials were neither sieved nor re-graded. After their physical properties and lead-leaching ability were characterized, these masonry materials were used for concrete with various mix proportions. The workability, lead-leaching ability and compressive strength of the concrete were studied. A cost-savings analysis was conducted to compare such a masonry deconstruction method with tradition ones (including LBP removal, hazardous and non-hazardous material disposal) for three hypothetical buildings. The results indicated that after being used as aggregate in Portland cement concrete, the lead is sequestered, or rendered non-leachable, due to the high alkalinity of Portland cement, and the concrete no longer has the toxicity characteristic for lead. Well-designed and well-manufactured concrete made with all LBP-contaminated, recycled aggregates can have satisfactory workability and strength for a variety of constructions, including roadways, parking lots and foundations. The savings from eliminating LBP removal and waste material disposal as well as minimizing the use of secure landfills range from approximately $4.63 to $412.80/m2, depending on the size of the deconstruction project and the applicable environmental protection regulations. Recycling such masonry materials as concrete aggregate is a cost effective and environmentally friendly approach. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Concrete; Cost; Lead; Masonry; Paint; Recycled aggregate","Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Environmental regulations; Hazards; Leaching; Lead; Mechanical properties; Paint; Painting; Portland cement; Recycling; Waste disposal; Conventional concrete; Deconstruction methods; Environmental friendly approach; Environmental protection regulations; Masonry; Portland cement concretes; Recycled aggregates; Toxicity characteristics; Masonry materials; cement; concrete; lead; paint; aggregate; concrete; cost-benefit analysis; environmental protection; lead; masonry; recycling; waste disposal; waste management; alkalinity; article; building material; compressive strength; contamination; cost control; dangerous goods; environmental factor; landfill; leaching; recycling; waste component removal; waste disposal",,"lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4",,,"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, SERDP","The authors would like to thank the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) for funding this work and the National Concrete Pavement Technology Center (CP Tech Center) at Iowa State University for their support.

They may contain several inorganic toxic chemicals such as heavy metals. Thus, a testing framework to evaluate their leaching behaviours and the relevant environmental impact needs to be developed. A parametric study was conducted using FE analysis to calculate the transport of the contaminant of concern (COC) in the surrounding subsurface to discuss the effects of influential factors such as the leaching concentration, infiltration rate, and flow rate of aquifer. In addition, a series of leaching tests was conducted for recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) to determine the leaching potential/concentration of COC for the environmental impact assessment. Three different acceleration tests; wetting-drying, freezing-thawing and abrasion, which actually occur in field conditions, were conducted respectively to evaluate the effect of the exposure to these conditions on the leaching of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) contained in the RCA, since physical and chemical properties of cement based secondary materials, such as RCA, may change under environmental conditions due to the loss of soluble constituents and/or the surface wearing. Exposure to these accelerated conditions, particularly the wetting-drying, promoted the leaching of Cr(VI). Leaching amounts of granular RCA exposed to these conditions are no more than that with the conventional batch leaching test, which is conducted for crushed RCA with < 2 mm in grain size. This finding suggests that the Cr(VI) leaching amount in the field can be conservatively estimated by the conventional batch leaching test. © 2009 IOS Press.","Environmental impact; Hexavalent chromium; Leaching; Recycled concrete aggregate","Acceleration tests; Batch leaching; Cement-based; Environmental conditions; FE analysis; Freezing-thawing; Geotechnical application; Geotechnical material; Grain size; Hexavalent chromium; In-field; Infiltration rate; Influential factors; Leaching concentrations; Leaching potential; Leaching test; Parametric study; Physical and chemical properties; Recycled concrete aggregates; Secondary materials; Testing framework; Toxic chemicals; Wetting-drying; Aquifers; Chemical properties; Chromium; Chromium compounds; Concrete aggregates; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Geotechnical engineering; Groundwater pollution; Heavy metals; Inorganic chemicals; Recycling; Soil mechanics; Solid wastes; Wetting; Leaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kosson, D.S., Van Der Sloot, H.A., Sanchez, F., Garrabrants, A.C., An integrated framework for evaluating leaching in waste management and utilization of secondary materials (2002) Environmental Engineering Science, 19, pp. 159-204; Kamon, M., Remediation techniques by use of ground improvement (2001) Soft Ground Technology, Proceedings of the United Engineering Foundation / ASCE Geo-institute Soft Ground Technology Conference, , J.L.

Batch experiments were conducted with the waste cement particles for the phosphate recovery from potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) solutions as a model of wastewater. For an initial concentration of the phosphate of 50 mgP L-1, which is close to that in the water effluent produced in the sludge dewatering process, and an initial concentration of waste cement of 1.0gL-1, approximately 50% of the phosphate was removed from the solution in 360 min. From the change over time in the concentrations of the phosphate, protons, and calcium ions, two reaction mechanisms can be considered: reaction at the surface of the waste cement particles, and the aqueous-phase reaction of the dissolved calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) with the phosphate. The results of SEM and XRD analysis showed that the phosphorus was precipitated as hydroxyapatite (HAP) on the surface of the waste cement particles. The observed reaction rate of the phosphate recovery was comparable to those in the conventional HAP crystallization methods. Considering that costly additives such as a calcium source, e. g. calcium chloride, and seed materials are necessary for the conventional HAP crystallization methods, the present process is highly competitive due to the negligible cost of the waste cement. © 2009 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.","Crystallization method; Hydroxyapatite; Phosphorus recycling; Sludge excess water; Waste concrete","Aggregate recycling; Batch experiments; Calcium hydroxides; Calcium ions; Cement particles; Crystallization process; Initial concentration; Phase reaction; Phosphate recovery; Phosphorus recovery; Potassium dihydrogen phosphate; Reaction mechanism; SEM; Sludge dewatering; Sludge excess water; Waste concrete; Wastewater treatment plants; Water effluents; XRD analysis; Agglomeration; Apatite; Brick; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Calcium chloride; Cement additives; Crystallization; Dissolution; Hazardous materials; Hydrated lime; Hydroxyapatite; Phosphorus; Reaction rates; Sewage pumping plants; Surface reactions; Toxicity; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Water treatment plants; Effluents",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cao, X., Harris Willie, G., Josan Manohardeep, S., Nair Vimala, D., ""Inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation under environmentally-relevant conditions"" (2007) Sci.

The non-metallic fractions (NMFs), which take up almost 70 wt% of waste PCBs, were treated by combustion or land filling in the past. However, combustion of the NMFs will cause the formation of highly toxic polybrominated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) while land filling of the NMFs will lead to secondary pollution caused by heavy metals and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) leaching to the groundwater. Therefore, recycling of the NMFs from waste PCBs is drawing more and more attention from the public and the governments. Currently, how to recycle the NMFs environmental soundly has become a significant topic in recycling of waste PCBs. In order to fulfill the better resource utilization of the NMFs, the compositions and characteristics of the NMFs, methods and outcomes of recycling the NMFs from waste PCBs and analysis and treatment for the hazardous substances contained in the NMFs were reviewed in this paper. Thermosetting resin matrix composites, thermoplastic matrix composites, concrete and viscoelastic materials are main applications for physical recycling of the NMFs. Chemical recycling methods consisting of pyrolysis, gasification, supercritical fluids depolymerization and hydrogenolytic degradation can be used to convert the NMFs to chemical feedstocks and fuels. The toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) can be used to determine the toxicity characteristic (TC) of the NMFs and to evaluate the environmental safety of products made from the recycled NMFs. It is believed that physical recycling of the NMFs has been a promising recycling method. Much more work should be done to develop comprehensive and industrialized usage of the NMFs recycled by physical methods. Chemical recycling methods have the advantages in eliminating hazardous substances in the NMFs. The trend in chemical recycling of the NMFs is to make the best of advantages over physical recycling of the NMFs to compensate its higher cost. Removing and treating the hazardous substances in the NMFs is an ultimate method to eliminate the pollution. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Water samples show that the water is located in Ordovician limestone and abnormal water level in X-down stratum of Ordovician limestone is found; and the potential leakage passage is determined, which may be caused by unfavorable cement blocking of boreholes. Because of the changes of the geological conditions of the boreholes' positions, the boreholes may penetrate into the water-enriched area of the Ordovician limestone; and then water drainages toward other aquifers with high pressure and high velocity will be formulated, which are the main factors induced by the unfavorable cement blocking of boreholes with the potential leakage passage.

They are used throughout the construction industry, in a wide variety of applications, such as concrete. Gypsum is a key component in cementitious products and comes from a range of natural and synthetic sources as a by-product of industrial processes. Alternatively, recycled gypsum from waste plasterboard also has the potential to be used in cements. Interest in finding alternatives to landfill for plasterboard and other waste gypsum products has increased with the escalating costs of disposal and their reclassification as non-hazardous non-inert waste. Coventry University in collaboration with Skanska and Lafarge Plasterboard recently undertook a WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme) funded research to develop a cost effective novel binder using recycled gypsum from waste plasterboard and a range of mineral wastes for construction of road foundations. This chapter gives details of this investigation on potential use of plasterboard gypsum in combination with a range of mineral wastes in road bases, sub-bases and stabilised sub-grades. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Cements; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Gypsum; Mineral resources; Recycling; Roads and streets; Cementitious binders; Cost effective; Escalating costs; Industrial processs; Recycled gypsums; Synthetic sources; Waste and resources action programme; Waste plasterboards; Waste disposal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Waste and Resources Action Programme www.wrap.org.uk/construction/plasterboard/background.html; (2006) Review of plasterboard material flows and barriers to greater use of recycled plasterboard, , www.wrap.org.uk/construction/plasterboard/report_review.html, Technical report for WRAP.

It will take courage for contractors and others in the construction industry to recycle selected types of waste materials in the concrete mixes. This paper addresses the recycling of rubber tires accumulated every year in Jordan to be used in concrete mixes. The main objectives of this research were to provide more scientific evidence to support the use of legislation or incentive-based schemes to promote the reuse of accumulated waste tires. This research focused on using crumb tires as a replacement for a percentage of the local fine aggregates used in the concrete mixes in Jordan. Different concrete specimens were prepared and tested in terms of uniaxial compression and splitting tension. The main variable in the mixture was the volumetric percentage of crumb tires used in the mix. The test results showed that even though the compressive strength is reduced when using the crumb tires, it can meet the strength requirements of light weight concrete. In addition, test results and observations indicated that the addition of crumb rubber to the mix has a limited effect toward reducing the workability of the mixtures. The mechanical test results demonstrated that the tested specimens of the crumb rubber concrete remained relatively intact after failure compared to the conventional concrete specimens. It is also concluded that modified concrete would contribute to the disposal of the non-decaying scrap tires, since the amount being accumulated in third world countries is creating a challenge for proper disposal. Thus, obliging authorities to invest in facilitating the use of waste tires in concrete, a fundamental material to the booming construction industry in theses countries, serves two purposes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This part presents the results of removal of toxic metals. The metals of concern (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mo, Ni, and Zn) were selected based on the priority toxicant pollutants defined in surface water quality criteria. Concentrations of these metals in the collected effluents varied more than the concentrations of PAHs and NPO, and thus only metal contents were considered for statistical analyses. These analyses determined significant differences (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001) between the mean metal concentrations in the column effluents and those in applied wash water of road tunnel. The results obtained during both experiments revealed that the organic sorbents, and in particular their combination, removed toxic metals more effectively from wash water of road tunnel than from wash water of tunnel electrostatic filters. Among the investigated toxicants, Al and Fe showed the highest levels of reduction in the column experiment, 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. The lowest reduction levels of 66.0% and 76.2% were found for Pb and Mo, respectively. The results of the bag experiment showed that even one day treatment of wash waters from tunnel electrostatic filters could reduce concentration of some toxicants by more than 70% (Al and Fe) and 80% (Cu). © 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","electrostatic filters; reduction level; sorbents; toxic metals; treatment efficiency; tunnel; wash water","Aluminum; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Arsenic compounds; Chromium; Columns (structural); Concentration (process); Concrete pavements; Copper; Effluents; Electrostatics; Experiments; Hydrocarbons; Lead; Lead alloys; Metal recovery; Metals; Molybdenum; Organic compounds; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Roads and streets; Sorption; Surface waters; Toxic materials; Tunnels; Vehicular tunnels; Water quality; Water recycling; Water treatment; Wave filters; Zinc; electrostatic filters; reduction level; sorbents; toxic metals; treatment efficiency; tunnel; wash water; Iron removal (water treatment); oil; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; effluent; experimental study; PAH; toxic material; tunnel; adsorption; article; chemistry; exhaust gas; methodology; Norway; traffic and transport; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Norway; Oils; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",,"Oils; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Vehicle Emissions; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"The experiments were carried out with financial support of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens Vegvesen Vegdirektoratet).

Thus, its disposal has become a major concern for environmental and economical reasons. At the same time, the concrete industry is gradually shifting toward green materials and practices with special focus on sustainable development. Because latex can improve some key properties of concrete, it may be possible to recycle WLP in concrete manufacturing with added value. In this study, fresh, mechanical, and durability properties of concrete incorporating various proportions of WLP were investigated. Moreover, leaching tests on aged concrete specimens incorporating WLP were carried out, along with a full-scale field test for constructing a stamped WLP concrete deck and sidewalk. The initial setting time of concrete was not reduced due to WLP addition, whereas the final setting was slightly reduced, which is perceived as an advantage. Concrete incorporating WLP was less vulnerable to the curing regime than conventional concrete. Compressive strength decreased with WLP addition, but adequate strength results for structural applications could be obtained with up to 20% WLP partial replacement for mixing water. The flexural strength of concrete increased with the addition of WLP. The durability of concrete was also significantly enhanced due to WLP addition, and no significant emission of toxic substances was detected in leaching tests of WLP concrete specimens subjected to 300 freezing-and-thawing cycles.

It is highly alkaline and hazardous, and typically disposed of by landfilling. This study examined the stabilization of municipal sewage sludge using concrete sludge as an alkaline agent. Sewage sludge was amended with 10 to 40% of concrete sludge by wet weight, and 10 and 20% of lime by dry weight of the sludge mix. Mixes containing 30 and 40% of concrete sludge with 20% lime fulfilled the primary requirements of Category 1 and 2 (Canada) biosolids of maintaining a pH of 12 for at least 72 hours. The heavy metals were below Category 1 regulatory limits. The 40% concrete sludge mix was incubated at 52°C for 12 of the 72 hours to achieve the Category 1 and 2 regulations of less than 1000 fecal coliform/g solids. The nutrient content of the biosolids was 8.2, 10 and 0.6g/kg of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium respectively. It can be used as a top soil or augmented with potassium for use as fertilizer. The study demonstrates that concrete sludge waste can be beneficially reused to produce biosolids, providing a long-term sustainable waste management solution for the concrete industry. © IWA Publishing 2008.","Alkaline; Biosolids; Concrete sludge; Reuse; Waste management","Biosolids; Fertilizers; Precast concrete; Reusability; Sludge disposal; Waste management; Alkaline; Concrete sludge; Sewage sludge; arsenic; cadmium; calcium oxide; chromium; cobalt; concrete; copper; fertilizer; heavy metal; lead; mercury; molybdenum; nickel; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; selenium; zinc; Biosolids; Fertilizers; Precast concrete; Reusability; Sewage sludge; Sludge disposal; Waste management; biosolid; concrete; industrial waste; recycling; sludge; waste management; article; biosolid; Canada; chemical industry; controlled study; dry weight; fecal coliform; municipal solid waste; nutrient; pH; recycling; screening test; sludge; soil; waste management; Alkalies; Biocompatible Materials; Chemical Industry; Conservation of Natural Resources; Feces; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Silicate Cement",,"arsenic, 7440-38-2; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; cobalt, 7440-48-4; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; lead, 7439-92-1; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; molybdenum, 7439-98-7; nickel, 7440-02-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; selenium, 7782-49-2; zinc, 7440-66-6; Alkalies; Biocompatible Materials; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Silicate Cement, 1327-39-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adjei, M.B., Rechcigl, J.E., Bahiagrass production and nutritive value as affected by domestic wastewater residuals (2002) Agron.

The new millennium brings challenges for the civil and environmental engineers and opportunities for research on the utilization of the solid waste and by-products and basic properties of concrete and its materials. The recycling of waste and by-products attracts an increasing interest worldwide due to the high environmental impact of the cement and concrete industries. Normal concrete is manufactured using sand and stones, but lightweight concrete can be made by using industrial by-products and hazardous solid wastes such as expanded fly ash, slag, sludge, etc. The Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) stabilization/solidification (S/S) can be used for treatment of concrete contaminated solid hazardous wastes and by-products. The performance of concrete is measured in terms of physical, engineering, and chemical properties. The review describes how chemical and mineral admixtures help in the improvement of the light-weight concrete properties. Cement is replaced by the 15-35% fly ash in the concrete mix. Fly ash increases concrete strength, improves sulfate resistance, decreases permeability, reduces the water ratio required, and improves the workability of the concrete. Partial substitution solid hazardous waste does not strongly affect the strength of concrete and other properties. This mixed light-weight concrete is safe enough to be used in sustainable environmental applications, like road-beds, filling materials, etc. © 2008 Advanced Study Center Co.

This process shows as advantage to the conventional chemically bonded ceramics based on Portland and high alumina cements a less permeable and soluble structure, which is more compatible with the treatment of noninert and even more environmentally dangerous residues. The mechanical strength developed by this ceramic, with cold crushing strength above 40 MPa after 24 h of curing, allows its use in a great variety of applications. The development of high mechanical strength within a short period of curing makes possible some uses where conventional binders have limitation. The efficacy of the encapsulating concrete was demonstrated by chemical, physical, mineralogical and microstructural characterization methods and also assessed by standardized leaching tests. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Recycled EG particles are divided into two portions according to their size: a substitutive material for natural fine aggregate and ultra fine filler, according to the particle size of 150 μm. The percentages of EG particles substituted for natural fine aggregate for the control mix were 10, 20, and 30 wt.% by considering suitable workability. Concrete strength can be significantly improved with EG particles due to the filling effect of ultra fine particles. However, as the substitute percentage of EG particles increases, the slump of fresh concrete drops and low workability is observed in the mixes with 30% EG particle even though superplasticizer is applied. Resistivity increases and absorption decreases as the percentage of fine EG particles substituted increases. The weight loss from sulfate immersion test reduces with the use of EG particles. Test results indicate that the proper application of EG particles would effectively modify the pore system, reduce permeability, and inhibit ions penetration in concrete. By considering the saving of land-fill disposal cost of waste epoxy and glass fiber scraps, enhancement of concrete properties, non-toxic waste leaching, and raw materials cost reduction, the effective utilization of recycled EG particles in concrete would be successfully achieved. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fine aggregate; Strength; Ultra fine filler; Waste circuit board","Aggregates; Copper scrap; Cost reduction; Fillers; Paper laminates; Particle size; Printed circuit boards; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Sulfur compounds; Toxic materials; Waste disposal; Concrete properties; Copper clad laminate; Fine aggregates; Printed circuit board scrap; Properties of concretes; Strength; Ultra fine fillers; Waste circuits; Concretes; Absorption; Agglomeration; Aggregate; Concrete; Electronic Equipment; Fillers; Filling; Glass Fibers; Leaching; Mechanical Properties; Paper Laminates; Raw Materials; Waste Disposal; Wastes",,,,,,"Financial support from Formosa Petrochemical Co. is gratefully acknowledged.",,,,,,,,,,"Alter, H., The Origins of Municipal Solid Waste: II Policy Options for Plastics Waste Management (1993) Waste Management and Research, 11 (4), pp. 319-332; Bertolini, L., Carsana, M., Cassago, D., Curzio, A.Q., Collepardi, M., MSWI Ashes as Mineral Additions in Concrete (2004) Cement and Concrete Research, 34 (10), pp. 1899-1906; Chen, C.H., Huang, R., Wu, J.K., Yang, C.C., Waste E-glass Particles used in Cementitious Mixtures (2006) Cement and Concrete Research, 36 (3), pp. 449-456; Copeland, L.E., Hayes, J.C., Determination of Non-Evaporable Water in Hardened Portland Cement Paste (1953) ASTM Bulletin, USA, pp. 70-74; Standards for Defining Hazardous Waste (2002) Environmental Protection Administration, , Taiwan; Forssberg, E., Cui, J., Mechanical Recycling of Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment: A Review (2003) Journal of Hazardous Materials, B99 (3), pp. 243-263; Güneyisi, E., Gesoğlu, M., Özturan, T., Properties of Rubberized Concrete Containing Silica Fume (2004) Cement and Concrete Research, 34 (12), pp. 2309-2317; Huang, W.J., Chu, S.C., A Study on the Cementlike Properties of Municipal Waste Incineration Ashes (2003) Cement and Concrete Research, 33 (11), pp. 1795-1799; Kuloglu, N., Effect of Astragalus on Characteristics of Asphalt Concrete (1999) Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, 11 (4), p. 283; Lee, B.K., Ellenbecker, M.J., Moure-Eraso, R., Analyses of the Recycling Potential of Medical Plastic Wastes (2002) Waste Management, 22 (5), pp. 461-470; Lin, K.L., Wang, K.S., Tzeng, B.Y., Lin, C.Y., The Reuse of Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator Fly Ash Slag a Cement Substitute (2003) Resources Conservation and Recycling, 39 (4), pp. 315-324; Naik, T.R., Singh, S.S., Huber, C.O., Brodersen, B.S., Use of Post-Consumer Plastics in Cement-based Composites (1996) Cement and Concrete Research, 26 (10), pp. 1489-1492; Park, S.B., Lee, B.C., Studies on Expansion Properties in Mortar Containing Waste Glass and Fibers (2004) Cement and Concrete Research, 34 (7), pp. 1145-1152; Pedroso, A.G., Mei, L.H.I., Agnelli, J.A.M., Rosa, D.S., Properties that Characterize the Propagation of Cracks of Recycled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polyamide 6 (1999) Polymer Testing, 18 (3), pp. 211-215; Polder, R.B., Test Methods for on Site Measurement of Resistivity of Concrete - a RILEM TC-154 Technical Recommendation (2001) Construction and Building Materials, 15 (2-3), pp. 125-131; Rai, A., Prabakar, J., Raju, C.B., Morchalle, R.K., Metallurgical Slag as a Component in Blended Cement (2002) Construction and Building Materials, 16 (8), pp. 489-494; Rouseková, I., Zivica, A.V., Silica Fume-Basic Blast Furnace Slag Systems Activated by an Alkali Silica Fume Activator (1997) Cement and Concrete Research, 27 (12), pp. 1825-1828; Singh, N.B., Bhattacharjee, K.N., Shukla, A.K., Effect of Alkali Bypass Dust on the Hydration of Granulated Blast Furnace Slag Blended Cement (1995) Cement and Concrete Research, 25 (4), pp. 883-892; Steinberg, M., Kukacka, L., Colombo, P., Kelsch, J.K., Manowitz, B., Dikeou, J., Backstrom, J., Rubenstein, S., (1968) Concrete Polymer Material First Topical Report, p. 83. , BNL 50134 (T-509); Topçu, Ì.B., Uğurlu, A., Effect of the Use of Mineral Filler on the Properties of Concrete (2003) Cement and Concrete Research, 33 (7), pp. 1071-1075; Veit, H.M., Diehl, T.R., Salami, A.P., Rodrigues, J.S., Bernardes, A.M., Tenório, J.A.S., Utilization of Magnetic and Electrostatic Separation in the Recycling of Printed Circuit Boards Scrap“ (2005) Waste Management, 25 (1), pp. 67-74; Wei, M.S., Huang, K.H., Recycling and Reuse of Industrial Wastes in Taiwan (2000) Waste Management, 21 (1), pp. 93-97","Huang, R.; Institute of Materials Engineering, 2 Pei-Ning Road, Keelung, 20224, Taiwan",,,,,,,,02533839,,,,"English","J Chin Inst Eng Trans Chin Inst Eng Ser A",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549128118

Sintered lightweight aggregate from sewage sludge is experimentally manufactured with various mass ratios of clay to sewage sludge by a rotary kiln, and is tested for density, water absorption, abrasion loss, crushing value, impact value and heavy metal leaching. Their physical properties are compared to those of a commercial sintered lightweight aggregate for nonstructural concrete. As a result, an experimentally manufactured lightweight aggregate with a recommendable sewage sludge content is similar or superior in physical properties to the commercial sintered lightweight aggregate. In particular, the water absorption of the lightweight aggregate recommended is about half or less than that of the commercial sintered lightweight aggregate. Because no toxic heavy metals are detected from the tested aggregate, it could be used as an environment-conscious artificial lightweight aggregate. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Plastic is one more major component of municipal solid waste (MSW) and is becoming a major environmental problem. In this research, the possibility of use of plastic in concrete is investigated. Plastic has low density and tend to float. This is taken care well as we propose to use it in Self Compacting concrete, which is like selfflowing liquid and is viscous and does not allow coarse aggregate to settle down. Same principle also does not allow plastic to separate and float out. Various types of concrete properties are studied to see the effect of use of plastic in concrete. It can be noted that we can get lightweight concrete by this method. © 2006 by School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology.","Disposal method; Light weight concrete; Mechanical properties of concrete; Municipal solid waste; Recycling of plastics; Self-compacting concrete","Coarse aggregates; Concrete properties; Disposal methods; Disposal techniques; Environmental problems; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Properties of concretes; Self-flowing; Fly ash; Light weight concrete; Mechanical properties; Self compacting concrete; Structural design; Municipal solid waste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2002) Status report on plastic generation and recycling in Delhi, , MCD town hall Report, Delhi 2001; (1998) Municipal Solid waste, , TERI Report No. 97/ED/52; Okamura, H., Ozawa, K., Self compacting high performance Concrete (2000) Structural Concrete, (1), pp. 3-17. , march; Okamura, H., Ouchi, M., (2003) Self compacting Concrete advanced concrete technology, 1 (1-15). , April; Saak, A.W., Jennings, H.M., Shah, S.P., New methodology for designing self-compacting concrete (2001) ACI material jour. nal., 98 (6). , November-December; Saak, A.W., Jennings, H.M., Shah, S.P., Characterization of the Rheological Parameters of Cement Paste for use in Self Compacting Concrete (2001) ACI material journal, 98 (6). , November-December; Subramanian, S., Chattopadyay, D., Experiments for Mix proportioning of Self compacting Concrete (2002) Indian Concrete Journal, , Jan; Gupta, S., Prabhat, K., Lepcha, K.C., Tripathi, S.M., Study the Effect of Hyperplasticizer on Characteristic of Concrete (2005) Proceedings of SCC 2005, 4th Int.

Combustion residues, however, may pollute the environment because they are enriched in potentially toxic elements relative to soils and sediments. For a proper assessment of the environmental impact of the utilisation and disposal of the ash it is necessary to understand the effect of the mobilisation of potentially hazardous elements from ash residues. Trace metals, though present as a relatively small fraction in fly ash, are of special interest, due to their cumulative build up, long life, and high toxicity to man, plants, and animals. Since trace elements existing in fly ash can leach out and contaminate soil as well as surface and groundwater resources, their study has recently been regarded as important in connection with the protection of the environment. The management of fly ash produced by coal fired power plants remains a major problem in many parts of the world. Although significant quantities are being used in a range of applications and particularly as a substitute for cement in concrete, large amounts are not used which requires disposal. Those quantities are disposed sometimes on unlined landfills. The original ash contains certain amounts of toxic elements and heavy metals. Such material, if inadequately deposited, can produce surface and ground water leachate pollution. Uses of fly ash have included the manufacture of lightweight aggregate, road base construction, landfill liners, sewage sludge treatment, as a filler in plastic composite materials, as well as the manufacture of Portland cement, etc. The use of fly ash in the ceramics industry and particularly as a component in the manufacture of bricks and tiles has also been investigated. This industry uses large volumes of silicate-based raw materials and therefore has the potential to utilize significant amounts of fly ash. Research is therefore needed to develop new alternative applications that can further exploit fly ash, which needs to be increasingly regarded as a raw material with a potential for processing into new products rather than a waste. Samples of lignite fly ash from the thermal power plant ""Nikola Tesla"" (Serbia) were investigated in the Case Study. Sintering, as a method of fly ash recycling, reduces leaching concentrations of elements. Special attention was paid to the determination of leaching properties by the Generalized Acid Neutralizing Capacity Procedure (GANG). Results of the analysis emphasise that the fly ash samples sintered at different temperatures have much lower leaching concentrations than the raw fly ash samples. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Ash; Impact assessment; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bayat, O., (1998) Fuel, 77, p. 1059; Fytianos, K., Tsaniklidi, B., Loudrias, E., (1998) Environ Int, 24, p. 477; Pu, W., Zhang-zhao, G., (1990) International Workshop on Utilization of Fly Ash, , Shanghai, China; Ilic, M., Cheeseman, C., Sollars, C., Knight, J., (2001) Fuel, 82, p. 331; Imyim, A., Tiruta-Barna, L., Mehu, J., Prediction of inorganic pollutant release from various cement based materials in disposal/utilisation scenario based on the application of a multi-parameter leaching tool box (2000) Waste Materials in Construction.

Residues from mining, fly ash from incinerator and heavy metal sludge from electronic waste were mixed into raw aggregate pellets and fed into a plow-type tunnel kiln to be sintered and finally cooled rapidly. Various feeding and sintering temperatures were employed to examine their impact on the extent of vitrification on the aggregate surface. Microstructural analysis and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) were also performed. Our results show that the optimum condition of ULWA fabrication is sintering at 1150°C for 15 min with raw aggregate pellets fed at 750 °C. The rapidly vitrified surface envelops the gas produced with the increase in internal temperature and cooling by spraying water to prevent the aggregates from binding together, thus forming ULWA with specific gravity below 0.5. ULWA produced by sintering shows good vitrified surface, water absorption below 10% and high cylindrical compressive strength. In addition, only trace amounts of heavy metals were detected, making the ULWA non-hazardous for construction use. With sintering time reduced to within 20 min, ULWA can be manufactured in larger quantity and shorter time, promising an alternative for profitable resource recycling and efficient waste management.","Light weight aggregate; Plow-type tunnel kiln; Rotary kiln; Shale","Compressive strength; Density (specific gravity); Light weight concrete; Microstructure; Recycling; Sintering; Toxicity; Waste management; Water absorption; Microstructural analysis; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure; Ultra-lightweight aggregate; Concrete aggregates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Short, A., W.

In ceramic industry about 30% production goes as waste, which is not recycled at present. In this study an attempt has been made to find the suitability of the ceramic industrial wastes as a possible substitute for conventional crushed stone coarse aggregate. Experiments were carried out to determine the compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths and the modulus of elasticity of concrete with ceramic waste coarse aggregate and to compare them with those of conventional concrete made with crushed stone coarse aggregate. The properties of the aggregates were also compared. Test results indicate that the workability of ceramic waste coarse aggregate concrete is good and the strength characteristics are comparable to those of the conventional concrete. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Any non-transpired effluent returns to a holding tank and is recirculated through the evapotranspiration channel until it is used. This paper examines the results from the Rockhampton trial site. Nutrient ions in the effluent were quantified over time and found not to accumulate in solution. Microbial analysis of the treated effluent was performed and was found to be within the ranges required by the relevant legislative codes. Citrus fruit grown in the evapotranspiration channel were sampled and no elevated levels of faecal coliforms were recorded. Macronutrients and micronutrients of the soil in the channels were measured over a 5-year period. No toxic accumulations or nutrient deficiencies in the soil occurred. Levels of salinity and sodicity in the evapotranspiration channel soil were quantified. Salinity rose slightly, as did sodium. Concentrations of salts and sodium did not reach unsustainable levels. The aim of the trial was to develop an on-site treatment and reuse system that is sustainable and protects public and environmental health. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Faecal coliforms; Nutrients; Recirculating; Salinity; Sodicity; Soil","Coliform bacteria; Effluents; Nutrition; Reusability; Salinity measurement; Soils; Toxic materials; Environmental health; Faecal coliforms; Macronutrients; Microbial analysis; Evapotranspiration; sodium; coliform bacterium; effluent; evapotranspiration; salinity; soil amendment; Australia; citrus fruit; coliform bacterium; effluent standard; environmental health; environmental parameters; evapotranspiration; feces microflora; nutrient; plant growth; review; salinity; sewage effluent; soil quality; university; waste water recycling; Citrus",,"sodium, 7440-23-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arridge, H., Oragui, J.I., Pearson, H.W., Mara, D.D., Silva, S.A., Vibrio cholerae 01 and Salmonellae removal compared with the die-off of faecal indicator organisms in waste stabilization ponds in Northeast Brazil (1995) Wat.

Over 5 billion tons of non-hazardous solid waste materials are generated in USA each year. Of these, more than 270 million scrap-tires (approximately 3.6 million tons) are generated each year. In addition to this, about 300 million scrap-tires have been stockpiled. Several studies have been carried out to reuse scrap-tires in a variety of rubber and plastic products, incineration for production of electricity, or as fuel for cement kilns, as well as in asphalt concrete. Studies show that workable rubberized concrete mixtures can be made with scrap-tire rubber. This paper presents an overview of some of the research published regarding the use of scrap-tires in portland cement concrete. The benefits of using magnesium oxychloride cement as a binder for rubberized concrete mixtures are also presented.

The properties of the MSWI fly ash slag were analyzed, to evaluate the feasibility of its reuse as a substitute for part of the cement required in mortar preparation. This MSWI fly ash slag was found to be comprised mainly of SiO2 and CaO, which can be substituted for up to 20% of the cement content in mortar, without sacrificing the quality of the resultant concrete. In fact, the concrete thus produced has greater compressive strength, 10% higher than that without the substitution. The setting time of the fresh mortar becomes lengthens as increasing amounts of cement are replaced; while the spread flow value increases with the increasing percentage of cement substitution. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that when the W/C=0.38 and the curing age=28 days, the crystal patterns in the mortar samples, prepared with different amounts of cement having been replaced by MSWI fly ash slag are similar. According to the results of the toxic characteristic leaching procedure analysis, MSWI fly ash slag should be classified as general non-hazardous industrial waste, that meets the effluent standard. Therefore, the reuse of MSWI fly ash slag is feasible, and will not result in pollution due to the leaching of heavy metals. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Nine possible applications were identified and grouped into four main categories: construction materials (cement, concrete, ceramics, glass and glass-ceramics); geotechnical applications (road pavement, embankments); ""agriculture"" (soil amendment); and, miscellaneous (sorbent, sludge conditioning). Each application is analysed in detail, including final-product technical characteristics, with a special emphasis on environmental impacts. A comparative analysis of the different options is performed, stressing the advantages but also the weaknesses of each option. This information is systemized in order to provide a framework for the selection of best technology and final products. The results presented here show new possibilities for this waste reuse in a short-term, in a wide range of fields, resulting in great advantages in waste minimization as well as resources conservation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Four types of fly ash resulting from different Italian MSW incineration plants were tested in this study. A modification of the chemical composition of MSW fly ash - through a preliminary four-stage washing treatment of this material with water - was attempted to improve the chemical and mechanical characteristics of sintered products. The sintering treatment of untreated or washed fly ash was performed on cylindrical compact specimens (15 mm in diameter and 20 mm in height) at different compact pressures, sintering temperatures and times. The sintering process of untreated MSW fly ashes proved to be ineffective for manufacturing sintered products for reuse as a construction material, because of the adverse chemical characteristics of these fly ashes in terms of sulfate, chloride, and vitrifying oxide contents. A preliminary washing treatment of MSW fly ash with water greatly improved the chemical and mechanical characteristics of sintered products and, for all the types of fly ash tested, the sintered products satisfied the Italian requirements for normal weight aggregates for use in concretes having a specified strength not greater than 12 and 15N/mm2, when measured on cylindrical and cubic specimens, respectively. A compact pressure of 28N/mm2, a sintering temperature of 1140°C, and a sintering time of 60 min were the best operating conditions for manufacturing sintered products of washed MSW fly ash. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The grit waste material originated from abrasive blasting of offshore steel structures. There is a major environmental concern regarding the safe disposal of the spent blasting abrasives that contain paint chips or paint particles and other debris removed from the surface of the steel structures. This work investigated the potential reuse of PCG in Portland cement concrete (PCC) and hot mix asphalt concrete. Several studies were conducted to establish the integrity of the materials containing the recycled grit. These included the chemical and physical characterization of natural sand and PCG, the assay of leaches associated with the grit material for hazardous metal contaminants, such as Cr, Cd and Pb, and the assessment of the mechanical properties of the PCG-substituted mortars by applying special tests (such as Marshall stability and determination of the flow properties) to the PCG-substituted asphalt concrete mixtures. The overall results demonstrated that the potential reuse of PCG in PCC and asphalt concrete mixtures would not pose any environmental threat and could produce several benefits, such as reduced disposal costs, protection of water sources from improper disposal practices and reduced costs in the production of natural aggregates and asphalt cement.",,"cadmium; cement; chromium; heavy metal; lead; article; cost; environmental impact assessment; heavy metal poisoning; painting; priority journal; sand; United States; waste disposal; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Paint; Silicon Dioxide",,"asphalt, 8052-42-4; Hydrocarbons; Silicon Dioxide, 7631-86-9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appleman, B.R., (1989) Roads Bridges, 27, p. 42; Hower, H.E., (1988) J.

An appreciable component of PCS is oily sludge, which is found as the dregs in oil storage tanks and is also produced as a result of oil spills on clean sand. The current method for the disposal of oily sludge is land farming. However, this method has not been successful as an oil content of < 1% w/w is required, and difficulty was encountered in reaching this target. The reuse of the sludge in asphalt paving mixtures was therefore considered as an alternative. Standard tests and environmental studies were conducted to establish the integrity of the materials containing the recycled sludge. These included physical and chemical characterization of the sludge itself, and an assessment of the mechanical properties of materials containing 0%, 5%, 22% and 50% oily sludge. The blended mixtures were subjected to special tests, such as Marshall testing and the determination of stability and flow properties. The experimental results indicated that mixtures containing up to 22% oily sludge could meet the necessary criteria for a specific asphalt concrete wearing course or bituminous base course. To maximize the assay from the recycled material, the environmental assessment was restricted to the 50% oily sludge mixture. Leachates associated with this particular mixture were assayed for total organic residue and certain hazardous metal contaminants. The results revealed that the organics were negligible, and the concentrations of the metals were not significant. Thus, no adverse environmental impact should be anticipated from the use of the recycled product. Our research showed that the disposal of oily sludge in asphalt paving mixtures could possibly yield considerable savings per tonne of asphalt concrete, and concurrently minimize any direct impact on the environment.",,"petroleum derivative; article; cost; environmental impact assessment; oil spill; priority journal; recycling; sand; sludge; soil treatment; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Silicon Dioxide",,"asphalt, 8052-42-4; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Silicon Dioxide, 7631-86-9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Meegoda, N.J., Huang, D.R., DuBose, B.H., Mueller, R.T., (1992) Hydrocarbon Contaminated Soils, 2, pp. 529-548. , ed.

The inorganic waste materials used were bottom ash and fly ash from incinerated municipal waste, incinerated ash from sewage sludge, concrete waste, and construction sludge. These waste were mixed with Ca(OH)2 and autoclaved for 6 h at 180 °C under saturated steam pressure. Except for the specimen by using incinerated ash from sewage sludge, the formation of tobermorite (Ca5(Si6O18H2)·4H2O) and hydrogarnet (Ca3Al2(SiO4)(OH)8) were observed. The flexural strength of the specimens varied from 3.2 to 16.2 MPa with the bulk density of 1200 to 1550 kg/m3. The higher SiO2 content and the finer particle size gave the higher strength. The amount of dissolved heavy metal (Pb) was decreased to 1/40 after autoclaving, suggesting the possibility of the heavy metal fixation by hydrothermal treatment. In addition, hydrothermally solidified specimens using incinerated ash from sewage sludge and construction sludge had 1.5 times of higher self humidity controlling property than the ordinal wood. © 2001 IEEE.",,"Ash handling; Calcium; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Humidity control; Lead; Manufacture; Mechanical variables measurement; Particle size; Sewage sludge; Concrete wastes; Construction sludge; High performance buildings; Humidity controlling; Hydrothermal solidification; Hydrothermal treatments; Recycling technology; Toxic heavy metals; Toxic materials",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ishida, H., (1998) Development Engineering.(Japanese), 17, p. 1; Suryavanshi, A.K., Scantlebury, J.D., Lyon, S.B., Mechanism of Friedel's Salt Formation in Cements Rich in Tri-calcium Aluminate (1996) Cement Concr.

At least two engineering projects were fully assessed in Taiwan for the possible installation of presorting facilities in order to increase the potential efficiency of material and energy recovery for municipal incinerators. But the reuse potential of incineration ash in light of toxicity leaching and compressive strength of concrete mixture remains unclear due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation for the ash characteristics. A comparative study for assessing the reuse potential of incineration ash based on two types of incineration processes was therefore performed in this study. The experimental results indicate that fly ash collected from both types of incineration processes is classified as a hazardous material because of their leachable metal contents. For the reuse of bottom ash as fine aggregate in concrete mixing, the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) incineration process shows higher potential than the solid waste incineration process without any presorting unit. But the concrete mixture with RDF incineration ash still presents a lower compressive strength by 23% as compared with the concrete made with conventional aggregate.

Construction activities affect the environment significantly, so environmental issues should be considered seriously. Thousands of miles of roads are paved every year with asphalt and steel-reinforced concrete. What are the environmental effects of the two materials? If asphalt has been used overwhelmingly over concrete, is it a better choice for sustainable development? We present results of a life cycle inventory analysis of the two materials based on publicly available data. We find that for the initial construction of equivalent pavement designs, asphalt appears to have higher energy input, lower ore and fertilizer input requirements, and lower toxic emissions, but has higher associated hazardous waste generation and management than steel-reinforced concrete. When accounting for the uncertainty in the data and when annualizing environmental effects based on assumed average service lives of the two pavement types, the resource input requirements and the environmental outputs are roughly comparable for the two materials. However, asphalt pavements have been recycled in larger quantities than concrete pavements, with consequent resource savings and avoided pollution, which suggests that asphalt may be a better choice from a sustainable development viewpoint. Of course, special functional requirements or economics may dictate the use of one material over the other in particular applications regardless of the overall environmental effects.",,"Asphalt pavements; Concrete pavements; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Life cycle; Materials balance; Pollution control; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Steel; Sustainable development; Life cycle inventory analysis; Highway engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Horvath, Arpad; Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",,,"National Research Council, Washington",,,,,03611981,,TRRED,,"English","Transp Res Rec",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032157999

The management of spent abrasive media by recycling it as a component of nonstructural concrete was investigated. Success was measured with respect to the TC criteria for leaching and a compressive strength requirement of 6.9 MPa (1,000 psi). Portland cement, with and without the additives used, successfully immobilized the metals present in the media. However, not all of the mixes prepared set, indicating that there is a limit to the amount of media that can be recycled in a concrete product. Mixes incorporating 100% unseparated spent abrasive sand and dust or slag in place of clean sand successfully met the project criteria. Mixes containing up to 25% addition of separated spent abrasive dust met the project criteria with the inclusion of appropriate mix additives. Based on results from this and earlier studies, the Texas Department of Transportation has begun to recycle spent abrasive media using portland cement. © ASCE.",,"Additives; Compressive strength; Concretes; Leaching; Management; Metals; Portland cement; Recycling; Toxicity; Nonstructural concrete; Spent abrasive media; Abrasives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brabrand, D., (1992) Solidification/Stabilization of Spent Blasting Abrasives with Portland Cement for Non-structural Concrete Purposes, , MS thesis, Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, Tex; Brabrand, D.J., Loehr, R.C., Solidification/stabilization of spent abrasives and use as nonstructural concrete (1993) Waste Mgmt., 13, pp. 333-339; Chin, D., A calcium nitrite-based, non-corrosive, non-chloride accelerator (1987) Corrosion, Concrete, and Chlorides; Steel Corrosion in Concrete: Causes and Restraints, AC1 SP-102, , Am.

Experiments were conducted on spent sandblasting grit to determine whether the grit could be incorporated into asphalt concrete for use as roadbed material, and a test roadbed was laid to evaluate the long-term stability of the metals found in the grit. Incorporation of the ABM in asphalt helps reduce the mobility of metal contaminants making the material suitable for reuse. The results of the initial characterization, treatability testing, and follow-up measurements of core samples taken from the test roadbed are presented to show that the use of abrasive blast material in asphalt roadbed material is a viable option under the proposed California regulatory standards.","Asphalt; Binders; Recycle; Solidification; Stabilization; Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)","Asphalt; Binders; Hazardous materials; Impurities; Industrial wastes; Materials testing; Recycling; Roadbuilding materials; Solidification; Stabilization; Standards; Toxicity; Abrasive blast materials; Metal contaminants; Roadbed materials; Sandblasting grit; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure; Treatability testing; Abrasives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Means, J.L., Headington, G.L., Ong, S.K., Nehring, K.W., Heath, J.C., (1991) The Chemical Stabilization of Metal-Contaminated Sandblasting Grit at Naval Station, Treasure Island, Hunters Point Annex: A Summary of Waste Characteristics, Bench-Scale Treatability, and Pilot-Scale Treatability Data, , Report to Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory from Battelle Memorial Institute, 3 volumes; Means, J.L., Headington, G.L., Ong, S.K., Heath, J.C., (1991) Characterization of Untreated and Treated Hunters Point Sandblasting Grit: Results of the Supplemental Sampling and Analysis Program of September, 1990, , Report to Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory from Battelle Memorial Institute; (1993) American Conference of Government and Industrial Hygienists; (1990) NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

For management of dyestuff wastewater, microbial technology becomes a novel approach since microorganisms have the characteristic ability to break down aromatic compounds and decolourize the dyes. Microbial treatment of a dyestuff wastewater containing phenol and methyl violet was studied at the site of a dye factory near Pune in a fixed film bioreactor. The bioreactor consisted of a rectangular cement concrete tank of dimensions 9.5 m length x 7.3 m breadth x 1.5 m height and brick pieces of size 10 cm x 8 cm x 6.5 cm used as supporting media for formation of microbial film. A mixed culture of Pseudomonas alcaligenes (phenol degrader) and Pseudomonas mendocina (decolourizing methyl violet) grown in the dyestuff wastewater was spread on brick media. After formation of a microbial film on brick media, the dyestuff wastewater was recycled in form of a shower through the brick bed for 24, 48 and 72 h. The influent loading rate was 1.44 m3/m2 brick bed area per day. The phenol and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) loading rates were on average 0.9 kg phenol/m2/day and 5.67 kg COD/m2/day respectively. The performance of the microbial degradation evaluated for a period of 68 days showed 97.5%, 63%, 54.4% and 51% removal in phenol, methyl violet (MV) content, COD and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) respectively in 24 hours of recycling and marginally enhanced in 48 and 72 hours. The microbial technology was thus effective in removal of phenol and the dye from dyestuff wastewater,","Dyestuff wastewater; Fixed film bioreactor; Methyl violet; Microbial treatment; Phenol; Pseudomonas sp.","aromatic compound; dye; phenol; bacterium culture; biodegradation; biofilm; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; conference paper; decolorization; India; Pseudomonas; recycling; waste water management; waste water recycling; Alcaligenes; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gadus morhua; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas alcaligenes; Pseudomonas mendocina; Pseudomonas sp.; Viola (angiosperm); Alcaligenes; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas alcaligenes; Pseudomonas mendocina; Viola (angiosperm); effluent treatment, microbial; effluents, dyeing; Aromatic compounds; Biofilms; Biological sewage treatment; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Chemical oxygen demand; Dyes; Environmental impact; Hazardous materials; Microorganisms; Phenols; Pollution; Dyestuff wastewater; Environmental pollution; Methyl violet; Microbial technology; Total organic carbon; Wastewater treatment",,"phenol, 108-95-2, 3229-70-7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anselmo, A.M., Novais, J.M., Isolation and selection of phenol degrading microorganisms from an industrial effluent (1984) Biotechnol.

SPC, which has been used as a construction material because of its excellent resistance to acid and salt environments and its superior water tightness as compared with Portland cement concrete, has recently emerged as a possible alternative binder to stabilize/solidify soils contaminated with hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes. However, it was found that the use of SPC alone could not satisfactorily stabilize/solidify lead-contaminated soils. Nevertheless, it was shown that additives, such as sodium sulfide or sodium sulfite, could be used to greatly enhance the ability of SPC to react chemically with lead contaminants, and physicochemically to bind these compounds. These enable us significantly to lower the leachability (e.g. from 77.8 mg Pb/l to 1.28 mg Pb/l in EPA TCLP extract) of the SPC-treated wastes to the point where they can be recycled as some form of construction material. © 1996.",,"Leachability; Sulfur polymer cement; Additives; Building materials; Cements; Contamination; Hazardous materials; Impurities; In situ processing; Polymers; Soils; Solidification; Stabilization; Sulfur; Waste treatment; cement; lead; polymer; sodium hydroxide; sodium nitrite; sodium sulfide; sodium sulfite; sulfur; article; hazardous waste; leaching; priority journal; radioactive waste; recycling; soil pollution; waste management; Cement; Contamination; Lead; Soils; Solidification; Sulphur Polymer",,"lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2; sodium nitrite, 7632-00-0; sodium sulfide, 1313-82-2; sodium sulfite, 7757-83-7; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lagrega, Buckingham, Evans, (1994) Hazardous Waste Management, , Ch. 11, McGraw-Hill, New York; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, (1989) Guide to Conducting Treatability Studies Under CERCLA, , EPA/540/2-89/058, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Washington, DC, and Office of Research and Development, Cincinnati, OH; Kingham, Practical overview of solidification/stabilization/fixation (S/S/F) treatability studies (1992) Treatment, 12, p. 303; U.S. EPA. 40 CFR, Part 261, 27–82 (1993); McBee, Sullivan, Fike, Sulfur Construction Materials (1985) Bulletin 678, , Centennial Edition, U.S. Bureau of Mines; Lin, Chian, Lai, Sustainable technology—using sulfur for solidification/stabilization of metal contaminated wastes (1994) OCESSA J., 11 (2), p. 17; Lin, Effectiveness of Sulfur for Solidification/Stabilization of Metal Contaminated Wastes (1995) Doctoral Dissertation, , Georgia Institute of Technology; (1985) ASTM Method D2166-85, Standard Test Method for Unconfined Compressive Strength of Cohesive Soil, , Am.

The first concern is over the amount of waste water that is generated in cleaning these trucks. The second concern is what effect, if any, these materials, which are considered hazardous by the EPA, might have when surface bodies of water and ground water become contaminated. This research project investigated the potential for recycling these waste concrete materials for the production of fresh concrete and mortar. A relatively new stabilizing admixture was also investigated as an aid in the recycling process. The resulting mortar was tested for compressive strength, sulfate resistance, workability, and setting time. © 1994.","EPA; Plastic concrete; Recyling; Setting time; Stabilizing admixtures; Strength; Sulfate resistance; Wash water; Workability","Compressive strength; Groundwater; Mortar; Reclamation; Recycling; Strength of materials; Wastewater disposal; Water pollution; Fresh concrete; Ready mix concrete trucks; Recycled wash water; Returned plastic concrete; Setting time; Sulfate resistance; Waste concrete materials; Workability; Concretes",,,,,"University of Texas at Austin","The authors are grateful to the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Advanced Technology Program for their support of this project.

FBC ash will present new challenges for coal-combustion by-product management. Calcium-based sorbents added to the combustion system of FBC make the properties of the resulting ash different from electric-utility fly ash. Recycling options, used to divert electric-utility ash from landfills, will have to be reevaluated for FBC ash. FBC ash from Central Soya Company’s circulating FBC boiler, previously located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was sampled over a 2-year period. The ash was analyzed for chemical and physical properties and evaluated as a concrete admixture. Results show that concrete strength and long-term durability are compromised by substituting FBC ash for Portland cement. The high pozzolanic activity of the ash and the decrease in leach-ability of some constituents with increasing ash content in concrete suggest that FBC ash has potential to be a good material for hazardous-waste solidification and stabilization. © ASCE.",,"Combustion; Fluidized Beds; Fly Ash; Calcium based sorbents; Chemical properties; Concrete admixture; Air pollution; Coal combustion; Concretes; Durability; Electric utilities; Fluidized bed combustion; Fly ash; Land fill; Physical properties; Recycling; Solidification; Standards; Coal ash; coal; air pollution control; article; ash; chemical analysis; combustion; controlled study; electric power plant; fluidized bed; hazardous waste; leaching; technology; waste management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, H.I., Gordon, J.S., Lowenbach, W.A., Sampling and analysis of emissions from fluidized-bed combustion processes—part 1 (1978) Analytical Methods for Coal and Coal Products, pp. 563-581. , C.

Possibly the best example of this is the nuclear industry which has to immobilize significant volumes of radioactive waste. A description is given of a synthetic high level waste-form which provides a material highly resistant to leaching by ground waters and which can retain its integrity in suitable geological conditions for the required one million years. Other methods that have been considered in the nuclear industry to immobilize radioactive waste include the incorporation of low and intermediate level waste into cementitious material and a considerable body of work has been carried out overseas in development of efficient methods of waste encapsulation of radioactive wastes in concrete. The use of concrete for the encapsulation of chemically hazardous solid waste has also been successfully used.",,"Hazardous Materials - Waste Disposal; Nuclear Reactors - Waste Disposal; Radioactive Wastes - Disposal; Hazardous Solid Waste; Industrial Solid Waste; Waste Management; Waste Recycling; Industrial Wastes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aldrildge, L.P.",,,,,,,,08168148,,PCENE,,"English","PACE Process Control Eng",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026111064

The buildings protect against seepage of leachate into soils and ground waters, emissions of volatiles, and contact of wastes with precipitation. Materials stored within the buildings would be available when technology and economics make recycling feasible. Hazardous wastes would be stored almost 10 feet (3.05 m) above land surface in a building designed for sub‐floor, walk‐through inspections for leaks. The proposed buildings can be as large as 250 feet (76.2 m) on a side and 70 feet (21.3 m) high and can support 9,000 pounds (40,000 N) of waste loading per square foot (0.305 m) of floor area. Each building, which can be constructed at virtually any location, would hold enough hazardous wastes to provide millions of dollars of return from construction of each building.
